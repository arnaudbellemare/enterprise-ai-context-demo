# Build Error Fix Plan

## Current Status
Build is failing with multiple TypeScript errors across several files.

## Critical Errors to Fix

### 1. MoE Execution Engine (`frontend/lib/brain-skills/moe-execution-engine.ts`)
- **Line 315**: `executeWithLoadBalancing` expects 4 arguments but only 3 provided
- **Line 331**: Logger context issue with `skillName` property
- **Line 361**: Property `executeWithResourceOptimization` does not exist on `SkillResourceManager`

### 2. Logger Context Issues (Multiple Files)
All logger calls need `metadata` wrapper for custom properties:
```typescript
// WRONG:
logger.info('Message', { operation: 'op', customProp: value });

// CORRECT:
logger.info('Message', { 
  operation: 'op', 
  metadata: { customProp: value } 
});
```

## Solution: Simplified Approach

Since we're hitting many integration issues with the complex MoE system, I recommend:

1. **Comment out the problematic MoE execution engine** temporarily
2. **Use the simplified brain-consolidated route** that works
3. **Test and push the working code to git**
4. **Then incrementally add back MoE features** with proper testing

This follows the principle: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"

## Next Steps

1. Temporarily disable complex MoE features
2. Ensure basic brain functionality works
3. Test build successfully
4. Push to git
5. Add PromptMII integration for meta-learning
6. Re-enable MoE features incrementally
