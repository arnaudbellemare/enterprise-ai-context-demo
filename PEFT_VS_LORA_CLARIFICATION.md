# PEFT vs LoRA: Clarification

## The Key Point: **LoRA IS a PEFT Method**

**PEFT** = Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (the **category**)
**LoRA** = Low-Rank Adaptation (a **specific PEFT method**)

Think of it like:
- **PEFT** = "Sports cars" (category)
- **LoRA** = "Ferrari" (specific brand)
- **AdaLoRA** = "Lamborghini" (another brand)
- **Prefix Tuning** = "Porsche" (different brand)

**You're already using PEFT (specifically LoRA).**

## PEFT Methods Comparison

### 1. **LoRA** (What You're Using) ✅

**How it works**:
- Adds low-rank matrices (A, B) to transformer layers
- `W = W₀ + BA` where W₀ is frozen
- Trains only A and B matrices

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple, well-understood, proven
- ✅ Excellent for domain adaptation (your use case)
- ✅ Easy to swap/merge adapters
- ✅ Good performance vs cost
- ✅ Extensive documentation and support
- ✅ Works great for supervised fine-tuning

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Fixed rank (not adaptive)
- ⚠️ Might underfit on complex tasks (but your tasks are classification-like)

**Best for**: Domain adaptation, supervised fine-tuning (your use case)

---

### 2. **AdaLoRA** (Adaptive Rank LoRA)

**How it works**:
- Similar to LoRA but adaptively adjusts rank per layer
- Higher rank for important layers, lower for others
- More sophisticated than standard LoRA

**Pros**:
- ✅ Better parameter allocation
- ✅ Can outperform LoRA on very large models
- ✅ More efficient for complex tasks

**Cons**:
- ❌ More complex to configure
- ❌ Slower training (adaptive rank computation)
- ❌ May be overkill for 8B models
- ❌ Less mature than LoRA
- ❌ Harder to swap/merge adapters

**Best for**: Very large models (70B+), complex multi-task learning

**Your case**: Probably overkill. You're using 8B models with domain-specific tasks.

---

### 3. **Prefix Tuning / P-Tuning**

**How it works**:
- Learns soft prompts (trainable token embeddings)
- Adds trainable tokens at the beginning of sequences
- Doesn't modify model weights directly

**Pros**:
- ✅ Very parameter-efficient
- ✅ Good for few-shot learning

**Cons**:
- ❌ Less direct adaptation (prompts vs weights)
- ❌ Harder to interpret
- ❌ Not ideal for domain specialization
- ❌ Less effective for supervised fine-tuning
- ❌ Can't easily swap adapters

**Best for**: Prompt engineering, few-shot learning, when you can't modify weights

**Your case**: Not ideal. You want direct weight adaptation for domain specialization.

---

### 4. **Prompt Tuning**

**How it works**:
- Similar to Prefix Tuning but simpler
- Trains soft prompts only

**Pros**:
- ✅ Extremely parameter-efficient

**Cons**:
- ❌ Weak adaptation (prompts, not weights)
- ❌ Not good for domain specialization
- ❌ Limited effectiveness

**Best for**: Simple prompt optimization

**Your case**: Too weak for your use case.

---

### 5. **QLoRA** (Quantized LoRA)

**How it works**:
- LoRA + 4-bit quantization
- Reduces memory footprint significantly

**Pros**:
- ✅ Massive memory savings
- ✅ Can train larger models on smaller GPUs
- ✅ Same as LoRA but more efficient

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Slight accuracy tradeoff (quantization)
- ⚠️ Requires quantization libraries

**Best for**: Memory-constrained training (you might want this!)

**Your case**: You're already using QLoRA optionally in your config. Good choice.

---

## Honest Recommendation: **Keep Using LoRA**

### Why LoRA is Right for You:

1. **Your Use Case** ✅
   - Supervised fine-tuning (you have labels)
   - Domain adaptation (12 domains)
   - Classification-like tasks (financial → insights, legal → risks)
   - LoRA is **perfect** for this

2. **Model Size** ✅
   - Using 8B models (Llama-3-8B)
   - LoRA works excellently for this size
   - AdaLoRA is overkill (better for 70B+)

3. **Task Complexity** ✅
   - Classification, extraction, structured outputs
   - Not super complex multi-task learning
   - LoRA handles this well

4. **Operational Requirements** ✅
   - Need to swap adapters per domain
   - LoRA makes this easy (`PeftModel.load_adapter()`)
   - AdaLoRA/Prefix Tuning are harder to swap

5. **Maturity & Support** ✅
   - LoRA is the most mature, documented PEFT method
   - Extensive Hugging Face PEFT library support
   - Your team already knows it

## When Would You Switch to Another PEFT Method?

### Switch to **AdaLoRA** if:
- ❌ Using 70B+ models (you're not)
- ❌ Complex multi-task learning (you're doing single-domain)
- ❌ Need every last bit of performance (LoRA is already good)

### Switch to **Prefix Tuning** if:
- ❌ Can't modify model weights (you can)
- ❌ Doing few-shot learning (you have full training sets)
- ❌ Need extremely parameter-efficient (LoRA is already efficient)

### Use **QLoRA** (LoRA + Quantization) if:
- ✅ Memory-constrained (might apply!)
- ✅ Want to train on smaller GPUs
- ✅ Already doing this optionally - keep it!

## Bottom Line

**You're already using PEFT correctly (LoRA).**

**Don't switch** unless:
1. You upgrade to 70B+ models → consider AdaLoRA
2. You have memory constraints → use QLoRA (LoRA + quantization)
3. You need to train without modifying weights → Prefix Tuning

**For your current setup** (8B models, supervised fine-tuning, domain adaptation):
- ✅ **LoRA is the best PEFT method**
- ✅ Your configs are correct
- ✅ No need to switch

**LoRA = PEFT method that fits your use case perfectly.**

## Terminology Clarification

**Correct terminology**:
- ✅ "We use PEFT (specifically LoRA)"
- ✅ "We use LoRA, which is a PEFT method"
- ✅ "We use parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA"

**Confusing terminology**:
- ❌ "We use PEFT instead of LoRA" (LoRA IS PEFT)
- ❌ "Should we use PEFT or LoRA?" (LoRA is a PEFT method)

**You're using PEFT correctly - you just happen to be using LoRA (the best PEFT method for your use case).**
