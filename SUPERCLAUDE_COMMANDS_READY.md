## Common Use Cases for PERMUTATION

### 1. Analyze Brain System
```
/sc:analyze frontend/app/api/brain/route.ts
```
**What it does**: Deep analysis of the brain route code quality, security, and architecture

### 2. Document Brain-Enhanced
```
/sc:document brain-enhanced system
```
**What it does**: Generate comprehensive documentation for Brain-Enhanced

### 3. Plan Feature
```
/sc:brainstorm integrate Sequential MCP with brain system
```
**What it does**: Interactive planning session for new feature

### 4. Troubleshoot Issues
```
/sc:troubleshoot TypeScript iterator errors in brain-skills
```
**What it does**: Systematic debugging assistance

### 5. Test Strategy
```
/sc:test create test plan for brain systems comparison
```
**What it does**: Generate comprehensive test strategy

### 6. Improve Code
```
/sc:improve brain route performance
```
**What it does**: Analyze and suggest improvements

## How Commands Work

Each command is a **specialized prompt** that:
1. Activates specific behavior modes
2. Follows structured workflows
3. Uses domain expertise
4. Provides consistent output

**Example - `/sc:analyze`:**
- Analyzes code quality
- Checks security issues
- Evaluates performance
- Reviews architecture
- Provides actionable recommendations

## Commands vs. Natural Language

**You can still use natural language!** SuperClaude commands are optional:

**With command:**
```
/sc:analyze frontend/app/api/brain/route.ts
```

**Without command (still works):**
```
Analyze the brain route for quality, security, and performance issues
```

**Benefit of commands**: More structured, consistent output

## Troubleshooting

### Commands don't appear in autocomplete

**Fix 1: Reload Cursor**
```bash
# Close and reopen Cursor window
# Or: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P ‚Üí "Reload Window"
```

**Fix 2: Check installation**
```bash
ls ~/.claude/commands/sc/ | wc -l
# Should show: 26
```

**Fix 3: Verify command format**
```bash
head -5 ~/.claude/commands/sc/help.md
# Should show YAML frontmatter
```

### Command runs but doesn't work as expected

**Check**: Make sure to type the full command with `:` separator
```
‚úÖ Correct: /sc:help
‚ùå Wrong: /sc help
‚ùå Wrong: /schelp
```

## What's Different from Regular Claude?

**Regular Claude:**
- General-purpose responses
- Varies based on phrasing
- No guaranteed structure

**SuperClaude Commands:**
- Specialized workflows
- Consistent output format
- Domain-specific expertise
- Follows best practices automatically

## Example Session

```
User: /sc:analyze frontend/app/api/brain/route.ts

Claude: # Code Analysis Report

## Quality Assessment
- Code complexity: High (2447 lines)
- Maintainability: Moderate
- Test coverage: Unknown

## Security Analysis
- API key handling: ‚úÖ Proper
- Input validation: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Needs improvement
- Error handling: ‚úÖ Good

## Performance
- Async operations: ‚úÖ Properly parallelized
- Timeout protection: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Caching: ‚ùå Not implemented

## Architecture
- Pattern: Subconscious memory
- Coupling: Moderate
- Scalability: Good

## Recommendations
1. Add input validation for query parameter
2. Implement response caching
3. Extract skill execution into separate module
4. Add comprehensive error types
...
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: `/sc:analyze specific_file.ts` better than `/sc:analyze`
2. **Use context**: Mention what you're trying to achieve
3. **Combine commands**: Use multiple commands in sequence
4. **Review output**: Commands provide structured output - review all sections

## Command Chaining Example

```
# 1. Analyze current code
/sc:analyze frontend/app/api/brain/route.ts

# 2. Based on analysis, improve
/sc:improve brain route based on analysis

# 3. Test improvements
/sc:test create tests for improved brain route

# 4. Document changes
/sc:document changes made to brain route
```
