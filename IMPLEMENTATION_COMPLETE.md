## 📁 **Files Modified**

### **1. `/frontend/app/api/agent-builder/create/route.ts`**
**Complete rewrite** - AI-powered workflow generation:
- `analyzeUserIntent()` - Extracts domain, locations, requirements
- `planWorkflowStructure()` - Creates optimal workflow plan
- `generateAdaptiveNodes()` - Generates universal nodes with roles
- `generateNodeConfigurations()` - Creates dynamic system prompts
- `generateSystemPrompt()` - Context-aware prompt generation

### **2. `/frontend/app/workflow/page.tsx`**
**Enhanced execution** - Universal node handler:
- Added dynamic system prompt support in existing node handlers
- Implemented universal default case handler
- Automatic API routing based on endpoint
- Support for `systemPrompt`, `role`, and `context` configs

### **3. `/frontend/app/agent-builder/page.tsx`**
**Added debugging** - Console logging for workflow storage

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: User Describes Intent**
```
"Property management in Montreal with legal advice for co-ownership and email responses"
```

### **Step 2: AI Analyzes Request**
```javascript
{
  domain: "property management",
  locations: ["Montreal"],
  specializations: ["legal", "management"],
  requiresWebSearch: true,
  requiresEmailGeneration: true,
  requiresLegalAdvice: true
}
```

### **Step 3: AI Plans Workflow**
```javascript
{
  name: "Montreal Property Management Assistant",
  description: "Property operations with Quebec legal compliance",
  stages: [
    { role: "Web Researcher", endpoint: "web_search" },
    { role: "Legal Expert (Montreal)", endpoint: "ai_agent" },
    { role: "Property Manager (Montreal)", endpoint: "ai_agent" },
    { role: "Communication Specialist", endpoint: "ai_agent" }
  ]
}
```

### **Step 4: AI Generates Nodes**
```javascript
[
  {
    id: "node-1",
    label: "Web Researcher",
    role: "Web Researcher",
    apiEndpoint: "/api/perplexity/chat",
    icon: "🔍",
    systemPrompt: "You are a Web Researcher. Gather real-time information..."
  },
  {
    id: "node-2",
    label: "Legal Expert (Montreal)",
    role: "Legal Expert (Montreal)",
    apiEndpoint: "/api/agent/chat",
    icon: "⚖️",
    systemPrompt: "You are a Legal Expert (Montreal). You provide accurate legal analysis... You specialize in Montreal regulations..."
  },
  // ... more nodes
]
```

### **Step 5: Workflow Executes**
Each node:
1. Receives context from previous nodes
2. Uses its dynamic system prompt
3. Routes to appropriate API
4. Produces specialized output
5. Passes data to next node

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Quebec Property Legal**
```bash
Input: "Property management in Montreal with legal advice for co-ownership and email generation"

Expected Output:
✅ Workflow: "Montreal Property Management Assistant"
✅ Nodes: Web Researcher → Legal Expert (Montreal) → Property Manager (Montreal) → Communication Specialist
✅ All nodes have Montreal/Quebec context
✅ Legal advice included
✅ Email generation ready
```

### **Test 2: Financial Analysis**
```bash
Input: "Analyze my investment portfolio with risk assessment"

Expected Output:
✅ Workflow: "Portfolio Analysis System"
✅ Nodes: Data Analyst → Risk Assessment Specialist → Investment Report → Financial Analyst
✅ Financial domain expertise
✅ Risk analysis included
```

### **Test 3: Marketing Campaign**
```bash
Input: "Create social media content with email marketing"

Expected Output:
✅ Workflow: "Content Creation Pipeline"
✅ Nodes: Marketing Strategist → Content Generator → Social Media Specialist → Communication Specialist
✅ Marketing focus
✅ Social media optimization
✅ Email automation
```

## 🔍 **Debugging**

The system includes extensive console logging:

```javascript
// Agent Builder
console.log('✅ Workflow data stored:', workflowData);

// Workflow Page
console.log('🔍 Checking for generated workflow:', 'Found/Not found');
console.log('✅ Loading generated workflow:', workflow);
console.log('🎉 Generated workflow loaded successfully!');

// Universal Node Handler
console.log('🤖 Universal Node Handler:', nodeLabel);
console.log('   Endpoint:', apiEndpoint);
console.log('   System Prompt:', systemPrompt.substring(0, 100) + '...');
```

Check browser console to see:
- Workflow storage confirmation
- Workflow loading status
- Node execution details
- API routing decisions

The system doesn't use predefined templates. Every workflow is generated fresh based on your specific request.

### **True AI Intelligence**
The AI actually understands what you're asking for and creates the optimal solution.

### **Universal Nodes**
One node type adapts to unlimited roles. No more hardcoded node types.

### **Context-Aware**
Every node knows:
- Where it is in the workflow
- What came before
- What comes next
- What the overall goal is

### **Location-Specific**
Automatically adds geographic context (Quebec laws, Montreal regulations, etc.)

### **Domain-Expert**
Nodes specialize in their domain (legal, property, finance, marketing, etc.)
