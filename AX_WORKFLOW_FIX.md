## ‚ùå **What Was Broken:**

### **Ax Report Generator**

**Problem:**
```json
{
  "answer": ": **The Miami Beach luxury real estate market in 2025 remains strong...**",
  "queryType": "math",  // ‚ùå WRONG! Should be "investment"
  "documentsUsed": 1,
  "processingTime": 5416
}
```

**Issue:**
- The API was **ignoring** the explicit `queryType: 'investment'` parameter
- Always calling `detectQueryType(query)` which misclassified the prompt
- Result: Short, generic response instead of comprehensive 6-section report

---

## üîß **The Fix:**

### **Updated `/api/answer/route.ts`:**

```typescript
// BEFORE:
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { 
      query,
      documents,
      preferredModel,
      autoSelectModel = true
    } = await req.json();

    // Always detect query type
    const queryType = detectQueryType(query);
    // ...
  }
}

// AFTER:
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { 
      query,
      documents,
      preferredModel,
      autoSelectModel = true,
      queryType: explicitQueryType // ‚úÖ Allow explicit query type
    } = await req.json();

    // Use explicit if provided, otherwise detect
    const queryType = explicitQueryType || detectQueryType(query);
    // ...
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ **Expected Results After Fix:**

### **Ax Report Generator Output:**

```json
