# Cost Optimization Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: MoE system achieving $0.0060/query (40% below target of $0.01)
**Opportunity**: Additional 50-70% savings possible through optimization
**Target**: $0.002-0.003/query (67-85% below current)

## Current Cost Structure

### MoE System (from test results)

**Per Query Costs**:
- Simple Query: $0.0060
- Complex Query: $0.0060
- Technical Query: $0.0060
- Dynamic Selection: $0.0030

**Average**: $0.0053/query

**Cost Breakdown** (estimated):
```
Perplexity Teacher: $0.003 (50%)
OpenRouter Student: $0.001 (17%)
OpenRouter Judge: $0.001 (17%)
Skill Execution: $0.001 (16%)
──────────────────────────────
Total: $0.006/query
```

### Performance vs Targets

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Cost/query | < $0.01 | $0.0060 | ✅ 40% better |
| Quality Score | > 0.90 | 0.91 | ✅ On target |
| Response Time | 2-5s | 20-38s | ❌ Too slow |
| Cache Hit Rate | 40-60% | 0% | ❌ Not enabled |

## Cost Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Enable Caching (50-70% savings)

**Current Problem**: Cache is disabled/not being used
**Impact**: Every query makes fresh API calls

**Solution**: Enable new modular system with caching
```bash
export BRAIN_USE_NEW_SKILLS=true
```

**Expected Savings**:
```
With 50% cache hit rate:
  Cached: $0.0001 (just retrieval)
  Uncached: $0.0060 (full cost)
  Average: $0.0030 (50% savings)

With 60% cache hit rate:
  Average: $0.0024 (60% savings)
```

**Implementation**:
- Already built in `brain-skills/skill-cache.ts`
- TTL: 30-60 minutes per skill
- LRU eviction policy
- Just need to enable feature flag

### 2. Optimize Teacher-Student Routing (20-30% savings)

**Current Problem**: Using expensive Perplexity teacher for all queries

**Opportunity**: More aggressive student model usage

**Current IRT Threshold**:
```typescript
const useTeacher = irtDifficulty > 0.7; // 70%
```

**Optimized Threshold**:
```typescript
const useTeacher = irtDifficulty > 0.8; // 80%
// OR
const useTeacher = (
  irtDifficulty > 0.75 &&
  context.requiredQuality > 0.85
); // Conditional
```

**Expected Savings**:
```
Current split: 70% teacher, 30% student
Optimized: 50% teacher, 50% student

Teacher: $0.003/query
Student: $0.0005/query

Current: (0.7 × $0.003) + (0.3 × $0.0005) = $0.0024
Optimized: (0.5 × $0.003) + (0.5 × $0.0005) = $0.00175
Savings: 27%
```

### 3. Implement Query Batching (15-25% savings)

**Current**: Each query executes independently

**Opportunity**: Batch similar concurrent queries

**Implementation** (already in code!):
```typescript
// In moe-orchestrator.ts
private shouldUseBatching(request, skills): boolean {
  return batchableSkills.length >= 2 &&
         !request.context.needsRealTime &&
         request.priority !== 'high';
}
```

**Expected Savings**:
```
3 concurrent queries:
  Individual: 3 × $0.006 = $0.018
  Batched: $0.012 (33% bulk discount)
  Savings: 33%

Realistic with 20% concurrent: ~7% average savings
```

### 4. Free Model Integration (30-40% savings)

**Current**: Using paid models for all operations

**Opportunity**: Use free OpenRouter models where appropriate

**Free Models Available**:
- Google Gemma 2 9B (quality evaluation)
- Alibaba Tongyi DeepResearch 30B (judge)
- Meta Llama 3.1 8B (simple queries)

**Already in use**:
```typescript
// quality_evaluation uses free model
model: 'alibaba/tongyi-deepresearch-30b-a3b:free'

// teacher_student uses free for student
model: 'google/gemma-2-9b-it:free'
```

**Extended Use Cases**:
- Simple queries (complexity < 3) → Free Llama
- Quality eval → Keep free Tongyi (already using)
- Summarization → Free Gemma
- Verification → Free Llama

**Expected Savings**:
```
30% of queries are simple → use free models
Savings: 0.3 × $0.006 = $0.0018/query (30%)
```

### 5. Dynamic Implementation Selection (10-15% savings)

**Current**: Using "balanced" implementation for all

**Opportunity**: Cost-optimized selection when quality allows

**Implementation Costs**:
```typescript
implementations: {
  fast: { cost: 0.001, accuracy: 0.85 },
  balanced: { cost: 0.002, accuracy: 0.90 },
  accurate: { cost: 0.004, accuracy: 0.95 }
}
```

**Smart Selection**:
```typescript
if (request.requiredQuality < 0.88) {
  return 'fast';  // $0.001 vs $0.002
}
if (request.budget && request.budget < 0.003) {
  return 'fast';
}
return 'balanced';
```

**Expected Savings**:
```
40% of queries can use fast:
  0.4 × ($0.002 - $0.001) = $0.0004 savings
  Percentage: 7% average
```

### 6. Skill Selection Optimization (5-10% savings)

**Current**: Selecting 3 experts consistently

**Opportunity**: Dynamic expert count based on complexity

**Logic**:
```typescript
const expertCount = Math.ceil(
  context.complexity / 2  // 1-2 for simple, 3-5 for complex
);

// Simple query (complexity 2) → 1 expert
// Medium query (complexity 5) → 2-3 experts
// Complex query (complexity 8) → 4 experts
```

**Expected Savings**:
```
Current: 3 experts/query
Optimized: 2 experts/query average

Per expert cost: $0.002
Savings: $0.002/query (33% on skill costs, ~10% overall)
```
