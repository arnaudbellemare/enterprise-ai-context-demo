# MoE Skill Router - Debug Summary

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **Expert Registration**: 8 experts are successfully registered in the MoE router
2. **Router Activation**: MoE router is correctly activated when `needsMoERouting` is true
3. **Scoring Logic**: The relevance scoring algorithm works correctly (tested standalone - produces score of 0.868)
4. **A/B Testing Framework**: Session creation and basic tracking implemented

### ‚ùå What's Broken:
1. **Relevance Scores Are Null**: All relevance scores come back as `null` instead of calculated values
2. **No Experts Selected**: Top-k selection returns 0 experts because all scores are null
3. **Missing Helper Functions**: Added `calculateComplexityMatch` and `calculatePerformanceScore` functions

## Root Cause Analysis

The relevance scoring function (`calculateRelevanceScores`) is defined and being called, but the scores are somehow becoming `null` in the response. Possible causes:

1. **Async/Await Issue**: The function might not be properly awaiting or returning the scores
2. **Serialization Issue**: The scores object might not be properly serialized in the response
3. **Execution Flow Issue**: The function might be timing out or failing silently

## Test Results

### Standalone Logic Test:
```bash
node test-moe-scores.js
‚úÖ Domain match: +0.4
‚úÖ Capability match: +0.3 (1/1)
‚úÖ Complexity match: +0.08
‚úÖ Performance score: +0.088
üéØ Total score: 0.868
```

### API Test:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/brain -d '{"query": "Analyze...", "domain": "technology"}'

Response:
{
  "relevanceScores": {
    "gepa_optimization": null,
    "ace_framework": null,
    "trm_engine": null,
    ...all null
  },
  "totalExperts": 8,
  "selectedCount": 0
}
```

## Debug Steps Added

1. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging to `calculateRelevanceScores`
2. ‚úÖ Added logging to `routeQuery` entry point
3. ‚úÖ Added logging to `registerExpert`
4. ‚úÖ Added missing helper functions (`calculateComplexityMatch`, `calculatePerformanceScore`)

## Next Steps

1. **Check Console Logs**: Need to see the actual console output from the Next.js server to see the debug logs
2. **Fix Null Scores**: Once we see the logs, we can identify why scores are becoming null
3. **Fix Top-k Selection**: After scores are fixed, ensure experts are properly selected
4. **Test A/B Framework**: Verify metrics are properly tracked
5. **End-to-End Test**: Complete pipeline test with complex queries

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/lib/moe-skill-router.ts` - Added helper functions and logging
2. `frontend/app/api/brain/route.ts` - Added MoE router integration
3. `test-moe-scores.js` - Standalone test for scoring logic

## Current Server

- Running on: `http://localhost:3001`
- Last test: Working, but MoE scores are null
- Next.js dev server logs should contain debug output
