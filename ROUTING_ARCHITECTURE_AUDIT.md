# Routing Architecture Audit: Is IRT Still the Best Choice?

**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Status**: üìä **EVALUATING CURRENT RESEARCH**  
**Question**: Should we update our routing architecture?

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: Using IRT (Item Response Theory) for query difficulty-based routing  
**Research Update**: IRT-Router proven effective in 2025, but alternatives emerging  
**Recommendation**: IRT is still excellent, but consider hybrid approaches

---

## Current Approach: IRT-Based Routing

### How We Use IRT

```typescript
// Our current implementation
const difficulty = await calculateIRT(query, detectedDomain);

if (difficulty < 0.3) {
  // Simple query: Fast path
  effectiveConfig.enableSRL = false;
  effectiveConfig.enableEBM = false;
} else if (difficulty > 0.95) {
  // Complex query: Full stack
  enableACE();
  enableTRM();
  enableSRL();
  enableEBM();
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Interpretable difficulty scores (0-1)
- Proven routing decisions
- Mathematical foundation
- Excellent for cold-start scenarios

### BEST-Route Framework (Latest) üî¨ **EMERGING ALTERNATIVE**

**Key Innovation**: Adaptive computational allocation

**Features**:
1. Selects both model AND number of responses to sample
2. Considers query difficulty AND quality thresholds
3. Significant cost reductions (up to 40%)
4. Minimal performance loss

**Approach**:
```
Query ‚Üí Difficulty Assessment ‚Üí Adaptive Sampling
  ‚Ä¢ Low difficulty: Fewer samples, cheaper model
  ‚Ä¢ High difficulty: More samples, better model
  ‚Ä¢ Cost-quality trade-off optimization
```

**Advantages Over IRT**:
- Explicitly optimizes for cost
- Adaptive sampling strategies
- Better resource utilization

**Disadvantages**:
- More complex to implement
- Requires quality estimation
- Less interpretable

**Our Assessment**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Better for cost optimization, but adds complexity

**Key Innovation**: Global + Local ELO ranking

**Features**:
1. Global ELO ranking of models
2. Local ELO ranking per query type
3. Dynamic model selection
4. Significant efficiency improvements

**Approach**:
```
Models ranked by ELO score
  ‚Üì
Query typed matched to local ranking
  ‚Üì
Select top model based on rankings
```

**Advantages**:
- Learns from experience
- Adapts to new models
- Proven scalability

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires training data
- Cold-start problem
- Less interpretable

**Our Assessment**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Good for established systems, not cold-start

---

### Hybrid Routing (General) üîÄ **BEST PRACTICE**

**Approach**: Combine multiple strategies

**Features**:
- Deterministic rules + probabilistic decisions
- Cost efficiency + high quality
- Adapts to query complexity
- Balances multiple objectives

**Our Assessment**: ‚úÖ This is what we should consider

## Recommendation

### Keep IRT as Primary Router ‚úÖ

**Why**:
1. Still state-of-the-art (ACL 2025)
2. Perfect for our cold-start scenarios
3. Highly interpretable
4. Proven effectiveness
5. Already implemented and working

### Consider Hybrid Approach üîÄ

**Enhancement**: Add cost-aware sampling (BEST-Route concept)

```typescript
// Enhanced routing with IRT + adaptive sampling
const difficulty = await calculateIRT(query, detectedDomain);
const costBudget = getCostBudget(query);

// IRT-based routing (primary)
if (difficulty < 0.3) {
  enableFastPath();
} else if (difficulty > 0.95) {
  enableFullStack();
}

// BEST-Route enhancement: Adaptive sampling
const samplingStrategy = determineSamplingStrategy(difficulty, costBudget);
if (samplingStrategy === 'economical') {
  reduceEBMSteps();  // Fewer refinement iterations
  useSingleTRMChain(); // One verification pass
} else if (samplingStrategy === 'quality') {
  enableFullEBM();  // Full refinement
  enableMultiTRMChains(); // Multiple verification
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Keep IRT's interpretability
- Add cost optimization
- Best of both worlds

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Keep Current IRT ‚úÖ **IMMEDIATE**

**Status**: Already implemented and working  
**Action**: No changes needed

**Rationale**:
- IRT is still excellent (proven in 2025 research)
- Our implementation works well
- No need to fix what isn't broken

### Phase 2: Add Cost-Aware Routing üü° **FUTURE OPTIMIZATION**

**When**: After core optimizations complete  
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)  
**ROI**: Medium (cost reduction)

**Enhancement**:
```typescript
// Add to PermutationEngine
interface RoutingConfig {
  enableCostAware: boolean;
  maxCost: number;
  qualityThreshold: number;
}

// Add adaptive sampling
const shouldUseCheaperPath = 
  difficulty < 0.7 && costExceeded(currentCost, budget);

if (shouldUseCheaperPath) {
  enableEconomicalMode(); // Fewer refinements
}
```

### Phase 3: Consider Eagle Router üü¢ **LOW PRIORITY**

**When**: If we have 1000+ queries with results  
**Effort**: High (5-7 days)  
**ROI**: Uncertain (needs training data)

**Rationale**: Only useful if we have historical data

4. **Already working** in our system

### Should We Upgrade?

**Keep IRT as primary** ‚úÖ
