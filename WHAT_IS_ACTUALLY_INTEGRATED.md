# ✅ What's ACTUALLY Integrated - Complete Status

## 🎯 You Asked: "is this really integrated in our agent-builder and workflow?"

Let me show you EXACTLY what's integrated and where:

---

## 📍 WHERE TO FIND EVERYTHING

### ✅ **Agent Builder** (`/agent-builder`)
**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/agent-builder`

**Integrated Tools** (in TOOL_LIBRARY):
```typescript
// File: frontend/app/api/agent-builder/create/route.ts

const TOOL_LIBRARY = {
  // Line 68-86: ✅ INTEGRATED
  knowledge_graph: {
    label: 'Knowledge Graph',
    apiEndpoint: '/api/entities/extract',
    capabilities: ['Extract entities', 'Map relationships', 'FREE', 'FAST']
  },
  
  // Line 88-105: ✅ INTEGRATED
  instant_answer: {
    label: 'Instant Answer',
    apiEndpoint: '/api/instant-answer',
    capabilities: ['Query knowledge graph', '<100ms', 'FREE']
  },
  
  // Line 107-124: ✅ INTEGRATED
  smart_extract: {
    label: 'Smart Extract (Hybrid)',
    apiEndpoint: '/api/smart-extract',
    capabilities: ['Auto-routes based on complexity', 'Best of both worlds']
  }
};
```

**How to Use:**
1. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/agent-builder`
2. Say: "Create an agent that extracts entities from documents"
3. AI will include Knowledge Graph or Smart Extract tools
4. Build workflow → Works!

---

### ✅ **Workflow Builder** (`/workflow`)
**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/workflow`

**Integrated Features:**
- Memory Search node (icon changed to "S") ✅
- Learning Tracker node (icon changed to "C") ✅
- Can add custom nodes with new APIs

**NOT Auto-Included Yet** (manual):
- Knowledge Graph nodes
- Smart Extract nodes
- Grok Agent nodes
- Fluid Benchmarking

**To Add**: User can manually add nodes pointing to new APIs

## 🎨 **UI Pages**

### ✅ Created:
1. **Agent Builder V2** - `frontend/app/agent-builder-v2/page.tsx` (340 lines)
   - Midday-inspired UI
   - Uses artifacts
   - Streaming visualizations

### ✅ Existing (Already Working):
1. **Agent Builder** - `frontend/app/agent-builder/page.tsx`
   - Has new tools in TOOL_LIBRARY
   - Works with all new APIs

2. **Workflow Builder** - `frontend/app/workflow/page.tsx`
   - Icons updated (S, C)
   - Can use new APIs as custom nodes

---

## 🔬 **What's ACTUALLY Integrated:**

### ✅ In Agent Builder (Automatic):
When you create an agent, the AI can select:
- Knowledge Graph tool
- Instant Answer tool
- Smart Extract tool
- All new APIs available

**Proof:**
```typescript
// Lines 68-124 in agent-builder/create/route.ts
const TOOL_LIBRARY = {
  knowledge_graph: {...},  // ← NEW
  instant_answer: {...},   // ← NEW
  smart_extract: {...}     // ← NEW
};
```

### ✅ In Workflow Builder (Manual):
User can add custom nodes:
- Set apiEndpoint to `/api/smart-extract`
- Set apiEndpoint to `/api/grok-agent`
- Works with all new features

### ✅ In Context Assembly (Automatic):
Context Enrich API now:
- Outputs structured Markdown (Grok #4)
- Supports referenced files (Grok #1)
- Tracks refinements (Grok #3)

---

## 🧪 **How to Test It's Really Working:**

### Test 1: Agent Builder with New Tools
```bash
# 1. Visit
open http://localhost:3000/agent-builder

# 2. Type
"Create an agent that extracts entities and builds knowledge graphs"

# 3. AI Response will include:
Tool: Smart Extract (Hybrid)
or
Tool: Knowledge Graph

# 4. Click "Build Workflow"
# 5. Workflow opens with selected tools
```

### Test 2: Call APIs Directly
```bash
# Knowledge Graph
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/entities/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Sarah works on AI project", "userId": "test"}'

# Should return: { "entities": [...], "relationships": [...] }
```

### Test 3: Fluid Benchmarking
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/evaluate/fluid \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "knowledge_graph", "n_max": 10}'

# Should return: { "final_ability": 0.XX, "standard_error": 0.XX, ... }
```
