## Implementation Details

### Judge Prompts

The system uses specialized judge prompts for each evaluation dimension:

1. **Accuracy Judge**: Evaluates factual correctness, logical consistency, domain knowledge
2. **Completeness Judge**: Assesses coverage, depth, examples, context, scope
3. **Clarity Judge**: Analyzes language clarity, structure, conciseness, jargon, flow
4. **Relevance Judge**: Measures direct relevance, scope match, context appropriateness
5. **Reasoning Judge**: Critical for RiR tasks - evaluates logical reasoning, step-by-step analysis
6. **Factual Judge**: Assesses factual accuracy, data accuracy, source reliability
7. **Coherence Judge**: Evaluates logical flow, consistency, transitions, unity
8. **Depth Judge**: Analyzes analysis depth, insight level, complexity handling

### Reasoning Analysis

For reasoning-intensive regression tasks, the system provides specialized analysis:

- **Logical Flow**: How well reasoning flows from premise to conclusion
- **Evidence Quality**: Strength of evidence used to support claims
- **Argument Strength**: How convincing the arguments are
- **Critical Thinking**: Demonstration of critical thinking skills

### Edge Case Coverage

The system analyzes how well responses handle edge cases:

- **Ambiguity Handling**: How well it handles ambiguous situations
- **Contradiction Detection**: How well it identifies and addresses contradictions
- **Context Sensitivity**: How sensitive it is to context changes
- **Domain Expertise**: How well it demonstrates domain expertise

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Test enhanced judge system
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/enhanced-gepa-optimization', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: 'Analyze the legal implications of using AI-generated content',
    domain: 'legal',
    maxIterations: 3,
    evaluationType: 'reasoning_intensive',
    strictness: 'strict'
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(`Improvement: ${data.improvement_percentage}%`);
console.log(`Final Score: ${data.final_score}`);
```

### Domain-Specific Configuration

```javascript
// Legal domain with reasoning-intensive evaluation
const legalConfig = {
  domain: 'legal',
  evaluation_type: 'reasoning_intensive',
  strictness: 'strict',
  focus_areas: ['legal reasoning', 'precedent analysis', 'risk assessment'],
  edge_cases: ['conflicting laws', 'jurisdictional issues', 'ambiguous regulations']
};

// Financial domain with regression evaluation
const financeConfig = {
  domain: 'finance',
  evaluation_type: 'regression',
  strictness: 'strict',
  focus_areas: ['financial analysis', 'risk assessment', 'market trends'],
  edge_cases: ['market volatility', 'regulatory changes', 'economic uncertainty']
