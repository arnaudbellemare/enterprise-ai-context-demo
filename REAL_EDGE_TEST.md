# üî• REAL EDGE TEST - NO MOCKS, NO BULLSHIT

## The Ultimate Question

**Does PERMUTATION actually have an edge over vanilla LLM calls?**

This test answers that question with **REAL data, REAL queries, and REAL metrics**.

---

## üéØ Test Setup

### Baseline (Control):
- **Direct Teacher Model Call** (Perplexity API)
- No preprocessing, no components, no optimization
- Raw LLM ‚Üí User

### PERMUTATION (Treatment):
- **Full 11-Component System**
- Domain Detection ‚Üí IRT ‚Üí Multi-Query ‚Üí ReasoningBank ‚Üí LoRA ‚Üí Teacher ‚Üí SWiRL ‚Üí TRM ‚Üí DSPy ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí KV Cache
- All optimizations active

   - Tests: Current information, critical thinking

3. **"Compare the tax implications of LLC vs S-Corp for a $500k/year revenue software business"**
   - Requires: Domain expertise, comparison, legal knowledge
   - Tests: Specialized knowledge, structured comparison

4. **"If Bitcoin drops 20% and Ethereum rises 15%, which should I buy and why?"**
   - Requires: Calculation, reasoning, recommendation
   - Tests: Analysis under hypothetical scenarios

5. **"What's the best strategy for diversifying a $1M portfolio in the current market?"**
   - Requires: Real-time data, domain expertise, strategic thinking
   - Tests: Current market awareness, financial expertise

## üìè Scoring Methodology

### Accuracy Score (0-100):
- **Base**: 50 points for non-empty answer
- **+10 points** for each requirement met:
  - Calculation (numbers, %, $, ratios)
  - Real-time data (current, latest, 2025, this week)
  - Domain knowledge (technical, specialized terms)
  - Analysis (compare, better, worse, pros/cons)
  - Reasoning (because, therefore, thus)
  - Recommendation (should, suggest, strategy)

### Quality Score (0-100):
- **Base**: 40 points
- **+10** for length > 200 chars
- **+10** for length > 500 chars
- **+10** for length > 1000 chars
- **+10** for structure (lists, numbering, formatting)
- **+10** for specific data (numbers, percentages)
- **+10** for reasoning (explanations, logic)

### Edge Metrics:
- Latency Difference (ms)
- Cost Difference ($)
- Accuracy Improvement (%)
- Quality Improvement (%)

---

## üèÜ Victory Conditions

PERMUTATION wins a test if:
- **(Accuracy + Quality) improvement > 5%**

PERMUTATION edge is **CONFIRMED** if:
1. PERMUTATION wins > 50% of tests, **OR**
2. Average quality improvement > 10%, **OR**
3. Average accuracy improvement > 15%

## üöÄ How to Run

### Via UI:
```
http://localhost:3005/real-edge-test
```
Click "RUN EDGE TEST" and wait 30-60 seconds

### Via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/api/benchmark/real-edge-test
```

---

## üìà Expected Outcomes

### If PERMUTATION Has Edge:
```json
{
  "edge_confirmed": true,
  "permutation_wins": 4,
  "baseline_wins": 1,
  "avg_accuracy_improvement": 15.5,
  "avg_quality_improvement": 12.3,
  "avg_latency_overhead_ms": 8500,
  "avg_cost_overhead": 0.0025
}
```

**Interpretation**: PERMUTATION provides +15% accuracy and +12% quality at the cost of 8.5s latency and $0.0025 per query. **Edge confirmed**.

### If NO Edge:
```json
{
  "edge_confirmed": false,
  "permutation_wins": 1,
  "baseline_wins": 3,
  "avg_accuracy_improvement": -5.2,
  "avg_quality_improvement": 2.1,
  "avg_latency_overhead_ms": 12000,
  "avg_cost_overhead": 0.0035
}
```

**Interpretation**: Baseline performs comparably or better with lower latency/cost. **No edge detected**.

## üéØ Success Criteria

The test is **SUCCESSFUL** if:
1. All 5 queries execute without errors
2. Both baseline and PERMUTATION return answers
3. Scoring is objective and reproducible
4. Winner is determined by measurable metrics

The test **PROVES EDGE** if:
1. PERMUTATION wins majority of tests
2. Quality/Accuracy improvements > thresholds
3. Overhead is justified by performance gains
