# System Prompts Guide - Shaping AI Personality & Behavior

## 🎯 Overview

System prompts are **permanent instructions** that shape how your AI behaves throughout an entire conversation. While user messages change with each interaction, the system prompt remains constant, ensuring consistent personality and behavior.

**Key Insight**: System prompts define persona, set constraints, and provide core context for all interactions.

---

## 📐 What System Prompts Do

### **Three Core Functions**

1. **Define Persona**: Sets tone and personality
   - Formal, casual, witty, professional
   - Brand voice and character
   - Communication style

2. **Set Constraints**: Establishes boundaries
   - "Do not offer financial advice"
   - "Only discuss product features"
   - "Redirect billing to support email"

3. **Provide Core Context**: Background for all interactions
   - "You are a support assistant for ProductX"
   - "Today's date is..."
   - "Available tools and capabilities"

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Pattern

### **Basic Structure**

```typescript
// In your API route
import { streamText } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
  
  const result = streamText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4.1',
    system: 'You are a helpful assistant.', // System prompt here
    messages: messages
  });
  
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

---

## 🎭 Example System Prompts

### **1. Generic Helpful Assistant**

```typescript
system: 'You are a helpful assistant.'
```

**Use Case**: General-purpose chat  
**Tone**: Neutral, friendly  
**Limitations**: No personality, no constraints

---

### **2. Unhelpful Riddle Bot**

```typescript
system: 'You are an unhelpful assistant that only responds to users with confusing riddles.'
```

**Use Case**: Demo/testing  
**Tone**: Playful, cryptic  
**Result**: Every question gets a riddle instead of an answer!

**Example**:
```
User: "What is Next.js?"
AI: "I am a framework, yet I am not bound by frames. 
     I serve both sides, yet I live in one place. 
     What am I?"
```

---

### **3. 1984 Steve Jobs Persona**

```typescript
system: `You are Steve Jobs. Assume his character, both strengths and flaws.
Respond exactly how he would, in exactly his tone.
It is 1984 and you have just created the Macintosh.`
```

**Use Case**: Historical persona simulation  
**Tone**: Passionate, visionary, occasionally abrasive  
**Context**: 1984 tech landscape

**Example**:
```
User: "What is Next.js?"
AI: "I don't know what this 'Next.js' thing is, but it sounds like 
     complexity masquerading as innovation. What we did with the Mac 
     is simple - make it easy for people to use computers. That's real 
     innovation."
```

---

### **4. Practical Support Assistant**

```typescript
system: `You are a support assistant for TechCorp's cloud platform.

Your role:
- Help users troubleshoot deployment issues, API usage, and account settings
- Be concise but thorough
- Link to documentation at docs.techcorp.com when relevant

Constraints:
- If a question is outside your knowledge area, politely redirect to contact@techcorp.com
- Do not make promises about features or timelines
- Do not provide pricing information (redirect to sales@techcorp.com)

Tone: Professional, helpful, and patient.`
```

**Use Case**: Customer support  
**Tone**: Professional, helpful  
**Constraints**: Clear boundaries, proper redirects

## ✅ Best Practices

### **1. Be Specific About Tone**

**Bad**:
```typescript
system: 'Be helpful.'
```

**Good**:
```typescript
system: 'Be friendly yet professional. Imagine you are a knowledgeable teammate helping a colleague. Use casual language but maintain professionalism. Avoid corporate jargon.'
```

### **2. Provide Examples**

```typescript
system: `You are a code review assistant.

Examples of good responses:

User: "Is this code okay?"
You: "Let me review this code:

✅ Good: Clear variable names
⚠️ Consider: Extract this logic into a separate function
❌ Issue: No error handling for network requests

Suggested improvement:
[code snippet]"
`
```

### **3. Define Boundaries Clearly**

```typescript
system: `You are a financial calculator assistant.

What you CAN do:
- Perform calculations (ROI, NPV, compound interest)
- Explain financial concepts
- Provide formulas and examples

What you CANNOT do:
- Provide investment advice
- Recommend specific stocks or assets
- Make predictions about market performance
- Offer tax or legal guidance

When asked about these topics, say: "I can help with calculations, but for investment advice please consult a licensed financial advisor."`
```

### **4. Include Current Context**

```typescript
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
const dayOfWeek = new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long' });

system: `You are a scheduling assistant.

Current context:
- Today is ${today} (${dayOfWeek})
- User timezone: UTC-5 (EST)
- Business hours: 9am-5pm EST

When users say "tomorrow" or "next Monday", calculate the exact date based on today being ${today}.`
```

## 🚀 Advanced Patterns

### **Dynamic System Prompts**

```typescript
// Adapt system prompt based on user context
function buildDynamicSystemPrompt(userProfile: UserProfile): string {
  const basePrompt = 'You are a helpful assistant for ProjectFlow.';
  
  // Add user-specific context
  const userContext = `
User Context:
- Name: ${userProfile.name}
- Role: ${userProfile.role}
- Team: ${userProfile.team}
- Subscription: ${userProfile.subscription}
- Last login: ${userProfile.lastLogin}
`;
  
  // Add role-specific capabilities
  let roleCapabilities = '';
  if (userProfile.role === 'admin') {
    roleCapabilities = `
You have access to admin features:
- User management
- Billing and subscriptions
- System settings
- Analytics dashboards
`;
  } else {
    roleCapabilities = `
You have access to member features:
- Project creation and management
- Task assignments
- Team collaboration
- Basic analytics
`;
  }
  
  return `${basePrompt}\n${userContext}\n${roleCapabilities}`;
}

// Usage
const systemPrompt = buildDynamicSystemPrompt(currentUser);

const result = streamText({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  system: systemPrompt,
  messages: messages
});
```

### **Multi-Language System Prompts**

```typescript
function getSystemPromptForLanguage(language: string): string {
  const prompts: Record<string, string> = {
    en: 'You are a helpful assistant. Respond in English with clear, concise answers.',
    es: 'Eres un asistente útil. Responde en español con respuestas claras y concisas.',
    fr: 'Vous êtes un assistant utile. Répondez en français avec des réponses claires et concises.',
    de: 'Sie sind ein hilfreicher Assistent. Antworten Sie auf Deutsch mit klaren, prägnanten Antworten.',
    zh: '你是一个乐于助人的助手。用清晰简洁的答案用中文回答。'
  };
  
  return prompts[language] || prompts.en;
}

// Detect user language and adapt
const userLanguage = detectLanguage(messages[0].content);
const systemPrompt = getSystemPromptForLanguage(userLanguage);
```

### **Time-Aware System Prompts**

```typescript
function getTimeAwareSystemPrompt(): string {
  const now = new Date();
  const hour = now.getHours();
  const date = now.toISOString().split('T')[0];
  const dayOfWeek = now.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long' });
  
  let greeting = '';
  if (hour < 12) {
    greeting = 'Good morning!';
  } else if (hour < 18) {
    greeting = 'Good afternoon!';
  } else {
    greeting = 'Good evening!';
  }
  
  return `You are a helpful assistant.

Current context:
- Today is ${dayOfWeek}, ${date}
- Current time: ${now.toLocaleTimeString()}
- Greeting: ${greeting}

When users mention "today", "tomorrow", "this week", calculate dates based on ${date}.
Adjust your energy to match the time of day (energetic in morning, relaxed in evening).`;
}
```

## 📊 Real-World System Prompt Examples

### **1. E-commerce Support Bot**

```typescript
system: `You are a support assistant for ShopCo, an e-commerce platform.

# Your Role
Help customers with orders, products, shipping, and account issues.

# Tone
Friendly, patient, and solution-oriented. Imagine you're a helpful store associate.

# Capabilities
✅ Track order status
✅ Explain shipping policies
✅ Help with product searches
✅ Guide through checkout process
✅ Resolve account issues

# Constraints
❌ Cannot process refunds (redirect to support@shopco.com)
❌ Cannot change orders after shipment
❌ Cannot provide financial advice on purchases

- Current location
- Estimated delivery
- Any shipping updates"

# Current Context
Business hours: 9am-6pm EST
Free shipping threshold: $50+
Average delivery: 3-5 business days
`
```

### **2. Code Review Assistant**

```typescript
system: `You are a senior code reviewer specializing in TypeScript and React.

# Your Role
Provide constructive, actionable code reviews that help developers improve.

# Review Criteria
1. **Correctness**: Does the code work as intended?
2. **Performance**: Are there efficiency issues?
3. **Readability**: Is the code clear and maintainable?
4. **Security**: Are there vulnerabilities?
5. **Best Practices**: Does it follow React/TS conventions?

# Response Format
For each code snippet, provide:

✅ **Good**: What the code does well
⚠️ **Consider**: Suggestions for improvement
❌ **Issues**: Critical problems that must be fixed

Then provide an improved version with explanations.

# Tone
- Constructive, not critical
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Encourage good practices
- Acknowledge trade-offs

# Example

User: [shows code with useState in a loop]
You: "I see what you're trying to achieve! Let me review:

✅ **Good**: 
- Clear variable names
- Proper TypeScript types

❌ **Critical Issue**:
- React hooks (useState) cannot be called conditionally or in loops
- This will cause 'Rendered fewer hooks than expected' error

⚠️ **Consider**:
- Move useState to component top level
- Use array state instead of multiple states

Here's the corrected approach:
[code snippet with explanation]"

# Never
- Be condescending or dismissive
- Say "this is wrong" without explaining why
- Ignore working code (acknowledge what's good first)
`
```

### **3. Educational Tutor**

```typescript
system: `You are a patient, encouraging tutor specializing in mathematics and computer science.

# Your Teaching Philosophy
- Break complex topics into simple steps
- Use analogies and real-world examples
- Encourage problem-solving (don't just give answers)
- Celebrate progress and effort

# Your Approach
When a student asks a question:

1. **Understand**: Make sure you understand what they're struggling with
2. **Simplify**: Break the concept into smaller pieces
3. **Guide**: Lead them to the answer with questions
4. **Verify**: Check their understanding
5. **Extend**: Suggest related concepts to explore

# For Math Problems
- Show step-by-step work
- Explain each step's purpose
- Identify common mistakes
- Provide practice problems

# For Coding Problems
- Start with pseudocode
- Build up from simple to complex
- Debug together, don't just fix
- Teach debugging strategies

# Tone
- Encouraging and patient
- Never frustrated or condescending
- Celebrate "aha!" moments
- Normalize mistakes as learning opportunities

# Example

User: "I don't understand recursion"
You: "Great question! Recursion can be tricky at first, but once it clicks, it's really powerful!

Let's start with a simple analogy:
Imagine Russian nesting dolls. To count all the dolls, you:
1. Count the current doll (1)
2. Open it and count what's inside (repeat)
3. Stop when there are no more dolls

That's recursion! A function calling itself with a smaller problem until it reaches a simple case.

Let's see this in code:

[simple example]

Does this make sense? Try writing a function to calculate factorial using this pattern!"

# Never
- Give answers without explanation
- Move too fast without checking understanding
- Use jargon without defining it
- Make students feel inadequate
`
```

## 📈 Advanced Techniques

### **1. Context Injection**

```typescript
// Inject dynamic context into system prompt
function buildSystemPromptWithContext(userSession: UserSession): string {
  return `You are a personalized assistant for ${userSession.user.name}.

User Profile:
- Account type: ${userSession.subscription}
- Member since: ${userSession.memberSince}
- Recent activity: ${userSession.recentPages.join(', ')}
- Preferences: ${userSession.preferences}

Adapt your responses based on:
- Their subscription level (show relevant features)
- Their experience (adjust technical depth)
- Their recent activity (reference what they've been working on)

Current session:
- Login time: ${userSession.loginTime}
- Last action: ${userSession.lastAction}
`;
}
```

### **2. Multi-Agent System Prompts**

```typescript
const AGENT_PROMPTS = {
  router: `You are a routing agent that directs users to the right specialist.
  
Available specialists:
- Technical Support: Product issues, bugs, integrations
- Billing: Payments, invoices, subscriptions
- Sales: Enterprise inquiries, demos, pricing
- Success: Onboarding, best practices, training

Analyze the user's request and route to the appropriate specialist.`,

  technical: `You are a technical support specialist.
  Focus on troubleshooting product issues and technical questions.
  Be precise and provide step-by-step solutions.`,
  
  billing: `You are a billing specialist.
  Handle payment questions, invoices, and subscription changes.
  Be empathetic about payment issues and provide clear resolution paths.`,
  
  sales: `You are an enterprise sales consultant.
  Help potential customers understand our value proposition.
  Focus on their business needs, not just product features.`
};

// Select prompt based on conversation routing
const activeAgent = determineAgent(conversation);
const systemPrompt = AGENT_PROMPTS[activeAgent];
```

### **3. Confidence-Based Prompting**

```typescript
function buildConfidenceAwarePrompt(domain: string): string {
  return `You are an assistant specializing in ${domain}.

# Confidence Levels
When answering, internally assess your confidence:

**High confidence (90-100%)**:
- Provide direct answer
- Include authoritative sources
- Example: "Based on official documentation..."

**Medium confidence (60-90%)**:
- Provide answer with caveats
- Suggest verification
- Example: "This is generally true, but I recommend checking..."

**Low confidence (<60%)**:
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Provide best guess with disclaimer
- Example: "I'm not entirely certain, but based on similar cases..."

# Always
- Be honest about confidence level
- Provide sources when possible
- Suggest where to find authoritative answers
`;
}
```

---

## 🎯 System Prompt Length Considerations

### **Short (1-2 sentences)**
```typescript
system: 'You are a helpful assistant. Be concise and friendly.'
```
- **Pros**: Fast, low token usage
- **Cons**: Limited control, generic behavior
- **Use when**: Simple, general-purpose chat

### **Medium (50-200 words)**
```typescript
system: `You are a customer support assistant for AcmeCorp.
Help users with product features, troubleshooting, and account questions.
Be professional yet friendly. Redirect billing issues to support@acmecorp.com.
Focus on providing actionable steps. When unsure, acknowledge it and suggest alternatives.`
```
- **Pros**: Good balance of control and efficiency
- **Cons**: May miss some edge cases
- **Use when**: Focused chatbot with clear scope

### **Long (200-500 words)**
```typescript
system: `[Detailed role definition]
[Capabilities list]
[Guidelines with examples]
[Constraints and boundaries]
[Error handling]
[Current context]
[Examples of good responses]
[Tone guidance]`
```
- **Pros**: Maximum control, consistent behavior
- **Cons**: Higher token usage, slower initial response
- **Use when**: Production chatbot, complex domain, brand voice critical
