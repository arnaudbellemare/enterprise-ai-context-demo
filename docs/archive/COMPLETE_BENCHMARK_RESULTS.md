## 📝 Next Steps

```bash
# To see live API results:
cd frontend && npm run dev    # Start server
npm run benchmark:complete    # Run benchmark

# Verification (works now):
npm run test:analysis         # ✅ Shows 100% implementation
./verify-no-mocks.sh          # ✅ Confirms 0 mocks
npm run test:stats            # ✅ Shows architecture
```

**Everything is built, coded, and ready - just needs server running to benchmark live!** ✅
