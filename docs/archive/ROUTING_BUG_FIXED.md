# 🔧 ROUTING BUG FIXED! Now Uses PERMUTATION-FAST! ✅

**Status**: ✅ **DEFAULT ROUTING FIXED!**

---

## 🐛 **THE BUG**

### **What You Were Seeing**:
```
Task: "Browse Hacker News"
Expected: PERMUTATION Stack with all 11 components
Got: "OPTIMIZED ACE EXECUTION" (old endpoint)

Logs showed:
❌ "OPTIMIZED ACE EXECUTION WITH LEARNED ROUTING"
❌ "Model: Perplexity only (fallback)"
❌ Only 14 steps
❌ Missing: Multi-Query, SQL, ACE bullets, ReasoningBank, LoRA, IRT, etc.
```

### **Root Cause**:
```typescript
// Line 282-284 in arena-simple.tsx

} else if (selectedTask === 'agentic-evolution-analysis') {
  endpoint = '/api/agentic-evolution-analysis';
} else {
  endpoint = '/api/arena/execute-ace-fast';  // ❌ BUG! Old endpoint!
}
```

**Problem**: The `else` clause defaulted to the OLD ACE endpoint, so ANY task not explicitly listed (like `hackernews`, `crypto`, `github`) fell through to the old system!

---

## ✅ **THE FIX**

### **Changed Line 284**:
```typescript
} else {
  // DEFAULT: Use PERMUTATION-FAST for all other tasks!
  endpoint = '/api/arena/execute-permutation-fast';  // ✅ FIXED!
}
```

**Now**: ALL tasks use PERMUTATION-FAST by default unless explicitly routed elsewhere!

---

## 🔄 **WHAT CHANGED**

### **Before** (Buggy):
```
Task Routing:
├─ swirl-trm-full → execute-permutation-fast ✅
├─ truly-full-system → execute-permutation-fast ✅
├─ hackernews → (falls through to else) → execute-ace-fast ❌
├─ crypto → (falls through to else) → execute-ace-fast ❌
├─ liquidations → execute-permutation-fast ✅
└─ github → (falls through to else) → execute-ace-fast ❌

Result: Some tasks used PERMUTATION, others used old ACE!
```

### **After** (Fixed):
```
Task Routing:
├─ swirl-trm-full → execute-permutation-fast ✅
├─ truly-full-system → execute-permutation-fast ✅
├─ hackernews → (falls through to else) → execute-permutation-fast ✅
├─ crypto → (falls through to else) → execute-permutation-fast ✅
├─ liquidations → execute-permutation-fast ✅
├─ github → (falls through to else) → execute-permutation-fast ✅
└─ ANY other task → execute-permutation-fast ✅

Result: ALL tasks use PERMUTATION by default!
```

## 🚀 **TEST IT NOW**

```bash
1. ✅ Server restarted with fix
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/agent-builder-v2
3. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R
4. Select: "Browse Hacker News" (or ANY task)
5. Click "Run Both Systems"
6. You'll now see: "PERMUTATION Stack" (not "OPTIMIZED ACE")
```

---

## 📊 **WHAT YOU'LL SEE NOW**

### **Instead of** (Old - What you were getting):
```
❌ "OPTIMIZED ACE EXECUTION WITH LEARNED ROUTING"
❌ "Model: Perplexity only (fallback)"
❌ 14 steps
❌ Missing components
```

### **You'll get** (New - After fix):
```
✅ "PERMUTATION Stack"
✅ "Architecture: SWiRL×TRM×ACE×GEPA×IRT + Teacher-Student"
✅ ALL 11 components shown:
   1. Smart Routing
   2. Multi-Query Expansion (60 variations)
   3. SQL Generation
   4. Local Embeddings
   5. ACE Framework
   6. ReasoningBank
   7. LoRA Parameters
   8. IRT Calculations
   9. SWiRL Decomposition
   10. Teacher-Student (Perplexity + enhancement)
   11. PERMUTATION Enhancement

✅ No "OPTIMIZED ACE EXECUTION" logs!
✅ Shows PERMUTATION workflow!
```
