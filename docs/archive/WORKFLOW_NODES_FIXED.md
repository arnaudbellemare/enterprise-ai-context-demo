# ðŸ”§ Workflow Nodes Fixed - Investment Report & Risk Assessment

2. **Insufficient context** - Models didn't know what to generate
3. **Poor model selection** - Using suboptimal models for the tasks

## ðŸš€ **Solution Implemented:**

### **1. Investment Report Node** âœ… FIXED

```javascript
query: 'Generate a comprehensive investment report'
```
