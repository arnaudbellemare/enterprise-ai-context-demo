## How to Verify Real Task Execution

This guide explains how to **verify that the system actually did what it claims** and isn't just showing mock data.

## 🎯 Testing Modes

### 1. **Standard Execution** (Default)
- Makes real API calls
- Shows real timing and costs
- Provides execution logs
- ✅ Good for: Quick testing

### 2. **Verified Execution** (With Proof)
- Everything in Standard, PLUS:
- **Real browser screenshots** from actual execution
- **Extracted data** from web pages
- **Downloadable execution reports**
- **Browserbase session links** for verification
- ✅ Good for: Proving the system works

## 🔍 How to Test with Verification

### Step 1: Enable Verified Execution

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/agent-builder-v2
2. Click **"🥊 Arena Comparison"** tab
3. Check the box: **"🔒 Verified Execution (with proof)"**

### Step 2: Select a Task

Choose from predefined tasks:
- **Check Crypto Prices**: Goes to CoinGecko, extracts Bitcoin/Ethereum prices
- **Browse Hacker News**: Extracts top trending stories
- **Review GitHub PR**: Navigates to GitHub repositories
- **Custom Task**: Enter your own instructions

### Step 3: Run Execution

Click **"🌐 Run with Browserbase"** or **"🧠 Run with Our System + ACE"**

Watch the real-time execution logs appear.

### Step 4: Verify Results

After execution completes, you'll see:

#### ✅ **Verified Execution Proof** Panel

Click through tabs:

1. **📋 Overview**
   - Session ID (can verify on Browserbase)
   - Target URL (where it went)
   - Data points extracted
   - Execution timestamp
   - Download full report button
   - Verify on Browserbase button

2. **📸 Screenshots**
   - Real browser screenshots taken during execution
   - Before and after comparisons
   - Download individual screenshots
   - Timestamp of each capture

3. **📊 Extracted Data**
   - Actual data pulled from web pages
   - Field-by-field breakdown
   - Download as JSON
   - View raw extracted content

4. **📝 Execution Logs**
   - Complete step-by-step trace
   - Real timing information
   - Error handling (if any)
   - Download full logs

## 🔬 Verification Methods

### Method 1: Check Browser Console

Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for:

```javascript
🚀 Starting REAL VERIFIED browserbase execution...
✅ browserbase execution completed: {...}
Is Real: ✅ YES
```

If you see `❌ NO (mock fallback)`, it means APIs failed and mock data was used.

### Method 2: Verify on Browserbase

1. After execution, click **"🔍 Verify on Browserbase"** button
2. Opens Browserbase dashboard with your session ID
3. See the actual browser session that ran
4. View recordings, logs, and timeline

### Method 3: Download Execution Report

1. Click **"📥 Download Full Report"**
2. Open the JSON file
3. Verify:
   - `isReal: true` (not false)
   - `proofOfExecution: true`
   - Real session IDs
   - Timestamps match execution time
   - Extracted data is present

### Method 4: Compare Screenshots

1. Click **Screenshots** tab
2. See actual browser screenshots
3. Verify the page content matches the task
4. Download and inspect images

### Method 5: Inspect Extracted Data

1. Click **Extracted Data** tab
2. See actual data from web pages:
   - `page_title`: Real page title
   - `page_url`: Actual URL visited
   - `bitcoin_price`: Real price (if crypto task)
   - `top_stories`: Real Hacker News stories
3. Cross-reference with actual website

## 📊 Real vs Mock Indicators

### Real Execution
- ✅ `isReal: true`
- ✅ `proofOfExecution: true`
- ✅ Real session ID
- ✅ Screenshots present
- ✅ Extracted data populated
- ✅ Verifiable on Browserbase

### Mock Fallback
- ❌ `isReal: false`
- ❌ `proofOfExecution: false`
- ⚠️ Error message explaining why
- ⚠️ "Mock:" prefix in logs
- ⚠️ Generic/simulated data

## 🎯 Example Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Crypto Price Extraction

**Task**: "Go to CoinGecko and get the current price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana"

**Expected Proof**:
- Screenshot of CoinGecko homepage
- Extracted data: `{ bitcoin_price: "$XX,XXX", page_title: "..." }`
- Session ID links to real Browserbase session
- Logs show: "Extracting cryptocurrency prices..."

**How to Verify**:
1. Check screenshot shows CoinGecko UI
2. Compare extracted price with actual CoinGecko website
3. Verify timestamp is recent (within test time)
4. Download report and inspect JSON

### Test Case 2: Hacker News Stories

**Task**: "Go to Hacker News and find the top 3 trending technology discussions"

**Expected Proof**:
- Screenshot of Hacker News homepage
- Extracted data: `{ top_stories: ["Story 1", "Story 2", "Story 3"] }`
- Stories match current HN front page

**How to Verify**:
1. Go to news.ycombinator.com manually
2. Compare extracted stories with actual front page
3. Check screenshot timestamp vs execution time
4. Verify story titles are real (not generic)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Is Real: NO" in Console

**Cause**: API credentials not configured or API failed

**Fix**:
1. Check `.env.local` has:
   ```
   BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=bb_live_...
   BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=4a7f...
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
   ```
2. Restart server after adding keys
3. Check browser Network tab for API errors

### No Screenshots Showing

**Cause**: Verified execution mode not enabled

**Fix**:
1. Enable "🔒 Verified Execution (with proof)" checkbox
2. Re-run the task
3. Check that endpoint is `/execute-browserbase-real`

### "Session not found" on Browserbase

**Cause**: Session may have expired or was deleted

**Fix**:
- Browserbase sessions expire after 24 hours
- Run a fresh execution to get new session

## 📈 Performance Comparison Verification

When both systems complete, you'll see:

### **Real Metrics**:
- Duration: Actual wall-clock time
- Cost: Based on real API usage
- Accuracy: Validated against task requirements

### **How to Verify**:
1. Check execution timestamps
2. Verify cost aligns with API pricing
3. Compare results between systems
4. Download reports from both for comparison

## 🔐 Security Note

- Never commit `.env.local` with real API keys
- Session IDs in reports may contain sensitive data
- Downloaded screenshots may show personal data

## 📦 Downloadable Artifacts

Each execution provides:

1. **Full Report** (`execution-proof-*.json`)
   - Complete execution metadata
   - Verification details
   - All extracted data
   - Timing and costs

2. **Screenshots** (`screenshot-*.png`)
   - Real browser captures
   - Timestamped images
