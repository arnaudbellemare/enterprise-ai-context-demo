## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### **1. Multi-Domain Benchmark System** (`frontend/lib/multi-domain-benchmarks.ts`)

**Purpose**: Systematic evaluation framework for all industries

**Key Features**:
- **1,200+ tasks** across 10 domains
- **Task categories** specific to each industry
- **Difficulty levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert
- **Industry-specific metrics** and KPIs
- **Regulatory requirements** tracking

**Task Distribution**:
```typescript
Financial:      138 tasks (XBRL, Market Analysis, Risk, Portfolio, Compliance, Trading)
Medical:        150 tasks (Diagnosis, Imaging, Treatment, Monitoring, Records, Drug Discovery)
Legal:          120 tasks (Contracts, Research, Due Diligence, Compliance, Litigation)
Manufacturing:  130 tasks (Quality, Maintenance, Production, Supply Chain, Process Control)
SaaS:           110 tasks (Customer Success, Product Analytics, Revenue Ops, Technical Ops, Growth)
Marketing:      120 tasks (Campaigns, Content, Segmentation, Attribution, Social Media)
Education:      100 tasks (Personalized Learning, Content, Analytics, Assessment, Institutional)
Research:       100 tasks (Literature Review, Hypothesis, Data Analysis, Collaboration, Grants)
Retail:         110 tasks (Demand Forecasting, Pricing, Customer Analytics, Inventory, Operations)
Logistics:      100 tasks (Route Optimization, Warehouse, Demand Planning, Visibility, Reverse)
```

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
import { MultiDomainBenchmarkSystem } from '@/lib/multi-domain-benchmarks';

const system = new MultiDomainBenchmarkSystem();
const medicalSuite = system.getDomainSuite('medical');
console.log(`Medical AI: ${medicalSuite.totalTasks} tasks`);
```

### **2. Domain-Specific ReAct Reasoning** (`frontend/lib/multi-domain-react.ts`)

**Purpose**: Specialized reasoning engines for each industry

**Specialized Engines**:
1. **MedicalReActReasoning** - Clinical decision support (15 steps, 95% confidence threshold)
2. **LegalReActReasoning** - Legal analysis and compliance (12 steps, 90% confidence)
3. **ManufacturingReActReasoning** - Process optimization (10 steps, 85% confidence)
4. **SaaSReActReasoning** - Business metrics analysis (8 steps, 85% confidence)
5. **MarketingReActReasoning** - Campaign optimization (8 steps, 80% confidence)
6. **EducationReActReasoning** - Learning optimization (10 steps, 85% confidence)
7. **ResearchReActReasoning** - Scientific analysis (12 steps, 90% confidence)
8. **RetailReActReasoning** - Retail operations (8 steps, 85% confidence)
9. **LogisticsReActReasoning** - Supply chain optimization (10 steps, 85% confidence)

**Factory Pattern**:
```typescript
import { MultiDomainReActFactory } from '@/lib/multi-domain-react';

// Create domain-specific engine
const medicalEngine = MultiDomainReActFactory.createReasoningEngine('medical');

// Get domain information
const domainInfo = MultiDomainReActFactory.getDomainInfo('medical');
console.log(domainInfo.regulations); // ['HIPAA', 'FDA', 'ISO 13485', 'GDPR']
```
