## 🔧 **What Changed:**

### **1. Initial Message Enhancement:**

```typescript
// BEFORE:
let resultPreview = 'Analysis completed';
if (result.response) {
  resultPreview = result.response.substring(0, 150) + '...';  // Only 150 chars!
}
return `- **${nodeLabel}**: ${resultPreview}`;

// AFTER:
let fullContent = extractFullContent(result);  // Get complete data
const preview = fullContent.length > 300 
  ? fullContent.substring(0, 300) + '... (see sidebar for full details)'
  : fullContent;  // Show 300 chars or full content

return `### **${nodeLabel}**\n${preview}\n`;  // Better formatting
```

### **2. Sidebar Enhancement - Expandable Results:**

**NEW FEATURE:** Each workflow node result is now displayed in an expandable `<details>` element:

```typescript
<details className="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-3 bg-white">
  <summary className="cursor-pointer font-medium text-xs flex items-center gap-2 hover:text-blue-600">
    <span className="text-blue-500">▶</span>
    {nodeLabel}
  </summary>
  <div className="mt-3 pt-3 border-t border-gray-100">
    <pre className="text-[10px] whitespace-pre-wrap break-words text-gray-700 max-h-64 overflow-y-auto bg-gray-50 p-2 rounded">
      {fullContent}  {/* FULL CONTENT SHOWN HERE */}
    </pre>
  </div>
</details>
```
