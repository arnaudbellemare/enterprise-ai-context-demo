2. ACE Context Assembly
   ↓ (Real processing)
   ↓ Builds context with learned concepts
   ↓ Multi-source context enrichment
   
3. GEPA Optimization
   ↓ (Real API: POST /api/gepa/optimize-cached)
   ↓ Ollama gemma3:4b optimizes prompt
   ↓ Cached for efficiency
   
4. Ax DSPy Execution
   ↓ (Real API: POST /api/ax-dspy)
   ↓ entity_extractor module
   ↓ Real Ollama gemma3:4b inference
   ↓ Structured entity output
   
5. Evaluation
   ↓ (Statistical matching)
   ↓ Compare with expected entities
   ↓ Calculate match rate
   
6. IRT Analysis
   ↓ (2PL model + MAP estimation)

## 📊 What the Results Mean

### **If Full System Wins (Expected):**

```
✅ Integration provides real benefit
✅ GEPA optimization helps performance
✅ ACE context engineering adds value
✅ ArcMemo learning improves accuracy
✅ Components work synergistically
✅ Architecture is validated
✅ Investment in complexity justified

Statistical Proof:
  • θ difference > 0.5 (large effect)
  • Z-score > 1.96 (statistically significant)
  • 95% CI doesn't overlap with baseline
  • Consistent across difficulty levels
```

### **If Individual Component Wins:**

```
⚠️ Integration isn't adding value yet
⚠️ May need tuning or more data
⚠️ Components might have bugs
⚠️ Need to investigate

But:
  ✅ Still proves system works
  ✅ Components are functional
  ✅ Identifies improvement areas
```
