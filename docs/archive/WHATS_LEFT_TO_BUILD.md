### **Option 2: Real LoRA Training** (Optional)

**Status**: Infrastructure ready, needs GPU training

**What It Is**:
- Train LoRA adapters on YOUR data
- Domain-specific fine-tuning
- GPU-based training (Windows machine)

**Do You Need It?**
- ❌ NO - we have 12 pre-configured LoRAs
- ✅ YES - if you have custom training data

**Timeline**: 1-2 days per domain

**Cost**: $0 (your GPU) or $50-200 (cloud GPU)

---

### **Option 3: Custom Embeddings** (Optional)

**Status**: Using general embeddings (work great!)

**What It Is**:
- Train custom embedding models per domain
- Better retrieval for specific use cases

**Do You Need It?**

**Cost**: GPU training time

---

### **Option 4: Data Partitioning** (Optional)

**Status**: Using single vector index

**What It Is**:
- Separate indexes by data type
- Chat vs spreadsheets vs documents

**Do You Need It?**
- ❌ NO - SQL generation solves this!
- ✅ YES - if you want +5-10% precision

**Timeline**: 4-5 days

**Cost**: $0 (just implementation)

## 💡 **FINE-TUNING DECISION TREE**

### **Do You Have Custom Training Data?**

**NO** → Skip LoRA training, use pre-configured!  
**YES** → Train LoRA when you're ready (GPU + data)

### **Do You Want Human-Aligned AI?**

**NO** → Skip judge training, Perplexity teacher is fine!  
**YES** → Collect feedback, train judge later (Phase 2-3)

### **Do You Need +10-20% Retrieval Boost?**

**NO** → Skip custom embeddings, general works!  
**YES** → Train custom embeddings when needed

### **Is Current Performance Acceptable?**

**YES** → Don't fine-tune anything! Ship it! ✅  
**NO** → Identify bottleneck, then fine-tune that specific part
