# ✅ Fix: Clarification Logic Too Aggressive

## 🚨 **Problem**
The Agent Builder was asking for clarification even for detailed requests like:
> "I want to create an agent that researches Montreal real estate markets, analyzes investment opportunities, and generates detailed reports with legal recommendations in the best you can from the legal quebec code."

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
The old clarification logic was too strict:
- Filtered out words like "create", "build", "make" 
- Required only 2+ meaningful words
- Didn't recognize domain-specific terminology

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **New Smart Clarification Logic:**

#### **1. Domain Keyword Detection**
```javascript
const domainKeywords = [
  'real estate', 'property', 'investment', 'market', 'analysis', 'legal', 'quebec', 'montreal',
  'finance', 'trading', 'portfolio', 'customer', 'support', 'marketing', 'content', 'social media',
  'healthcare', 'medical', 'technology', 'software', 'development', 'research', 'report',
  'email', 'communication', 'tenant', 'co-ownership', 'regulation', 'compliance'
];
```

#### **2. Action Keyword Detection**
```javascript
const actionKeywords = [
  'researches', 'analyzes', 'generates', 'creates', 'manages', 'handles', 'processes',
  'calculates', 'evaluates', 'assesses', 'recommends', 'advises', 'reports'
];
```

#### **3. Specificity Detection**
```javascript
const specificKeywords = [
  'montreal', 'quebec', 'miami', 'new york', 'toronto', 'vancouver',
  'real estate', 'property management', 'investment', 'finance', 'legal advice'
];
```

### **Logic Flow:**
```
1. Check word count (minimum 5 words)
2. Check domain keywords → If found, proceed to generate
3. Check action keywords → If found, proceed to generate  
4. Check specific keywords → If found, proceed to generate
5. Only ask for clarification if none found
```
