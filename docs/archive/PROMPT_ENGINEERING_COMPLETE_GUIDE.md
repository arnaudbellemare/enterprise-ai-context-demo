## ðŸš€ **KV Cache Optimization Integration**

### **Cache-Friendly Prompt Structure**

The 10-component structure is optimized for KV cache efficiency:

```typescript
// Cached Components (Reusable across queries)
const cachedPrefix = [
  taskContext,      // Component 1
  toneContext,      // Component 2  
  backgroundData,   // Component 3
  detailedRules,    // Component 4
  examples         // Component 5
].join('\n\n');

// Dynamic Components (Query-specific)
const dynamicSuffix = [
  conversationHistory,  // Component 6
  immediateTask,        // Component 7
  thinkingStep,         // Component 8
  outputFormatting,     // Component 9
  prefilledResponse     // Component 10
].join('\n\n');
```

### **Token Savings Analysis**

| Component | Cached | Dynamic | Token Count | Reuse Rate |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Task Context | âœ… | | ~200 | 100% |
| Tone Context | âœ… | | ~100 | 100% |
| Background Data | âœ… | | ~500 | 100% |
| Detailed Rules | âœ… | | ~300 | 100% |
| Examples | âœ… | | ~400 | 100% |
| Conversation History | | âœ… | ~200 | 0% |
| Immediate Task | | âœ… | ~50 | 0% |
| Thinking Step | | âœ… | ~100 | 0% |
| Output Formatting | | âœ… | ~20 | 0% |
| Prefilled Response | | âœ… | ~10 | 0% |

**Total Savings:** ~1,500 cached tokens reused across multiple queries = **85-90% token reuse**

## ðŸ§  **ACE Framework Integration**

### **Playbook Context Enhancement**

Integrate ACE's evolving playbook into the background data:

```typescript
const aceEnhancedBackground = `
Career guidance playbook (ACE-enhanced):
${playbook.bullets.map(b => `[${b.id}] ${b.content}`).join('\n')}

Playbook stats:
- Total strategies: ${playbook.stats.total_bullets}
- Success rate: ${playbook.stats.helpful_ratio}
- Last updated: ${playbook.stats.last_updated}
`;
```

### **Reflection Integration**

Enhance the thinking step with ACE reflection:

```typescript
const aceEnhancedThinking = `
How do you respond to the user's question?
Think about your answer first before you respond. Consider:

1. What specific career advice is needed?
2. How can you reference the ACE playbook strategies?
3. What actionable steps can you provide?
4. How do you maintain Joe's character and tone?

ACE Reflection: Analyze this interaction for potential playbook updates.
- Was the response effective?
- What strategies worked well?
- What could be improved?
- Should this be added to the playbook?
`;
```

**Diagnosis:** Your middle lacks tension and character growth. The protagonist needs obstacles that force internal change.

**Techniques to try:**
1. "The Midpoint Reversal" - introduce a major plot twist that changes everything
2. "Character Crucible" - put your protagonist in an impossible situation
3. "Subplot Weaving" - introduce secondary conflicts that mirror the main theme

**Exercise:** Write a scene where your character makes a choice that surprises even you.
</example>`
