## 🎯 **What Is This?**

The **Real-Time Reasoning Visualization** feature lets you watch PERMUTATION's AI reasoning process as it happens, displaying each component's contribution before showing the final answer.

This provides **complete transparency** into:
- How the AI thinks
- What components are being used
- How the answer evolves through iterations
- Verification and quality checks

## 📊 **Reasoning Steps Displayed**

### **Step 1: Domain Detection** 🎯
```
Analyzing query to determine domain...
→ Domain: crypto
→ Applying specialized strategies
```

**What's happening**: The system classifies your query into a domain (financial, crypto, legal, healthcare, general, etc.) to apply specialized knowledge.

---

### **Step 2: ACE Framework - Strategy Selection** 🧠
```
Loading domain-specific playbook...
→ Strategies:
  1. Check current prices
  2. Verify multiple exchanges
  3. Consider volatility
  4. Assess risk cascades
```

**What's happening**: ACE (Agentic Context Engineering) loads proven strategies from the domain's "playbook" - these are learned patterns from previous successes.

---

### **Step 3: Multi-Query Expansion** 🔍
```
Creating multiple query perspectives...
→ Generated 5 query variations:
  1. "What are Bitcoin liquidations?"
  2. "Latest updates on Bitcoin liquidations"
  3. "Can you explain Bitcoin liquidations in detail?"
  4. "What are the implications?"
  5. "Compare different perspectives"
```

**What's happening**: Instead of just one query, PERMUTATION generates multiple variations to ensure comprehensive coverage and no missed information.

---

### **Step 4: IRT Difficulty Assessment** 📊
```
Using Item Response Theory to estimate complexity...
→ Difficulty: 0.52 (Medium)
→ Expected Accuracy: 82.3%
→ Confidence Interval: [0.70, 1.00]
```

**What's happening**: IRT (Item Response Theory) scientifically assesses the task's difficulty and predicts PERMUTATION's expected accuracy with confidence intervals.

---

### **Step 5: ReasoningBank Memory Retrieval** 🗄️
```
Searching for similar past solutions...
→ Found 3 relevant memories:
  1. Multi-source validation works best for this type
  2. Users appreciate step-by-step breakdowns
  3. Include confidence metrics for transparency
```

**What's happening**: ReasoningBank retrieves learned patterns from previous similar tasks, applying accumulated knowledge to improve the current response.

---

### **Step 6: LoRA Domain Optimization** ⚡
```
Loading domain-specific fine-tuned parameters...
→ Rank: 8, Alpha: 16
→ Optimized for crypto domain with low weight decay
```

**What's happening**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) applies specialized fine-tuning for the specific domain, making the model an "expert" in that area.

---

### **Step 7: Teacher Model - Perplexity Search** 🌐
```
Fetching real-time data from Perplexity API...
→ Retrieved 5 sources with citations
→ Processing web search results...
```

**What's happening**: For queries requiring current information, Perplexity acts as the "teacher," fetching real-time data from the web with citations.

---

### **Step 8: DSPy Refine - Iterative Improvement** 🔄
```
Iteration 1/3: Generating initial response...
→ Quality Score: 0.65
→ Improvement: Added domain context

Iteration 2/3: Refining with custom reward function...
→ Quality Score: 0.82 (+17%)
→ Improvement: Enhanced clarity, added examples

Iteration 3/3: Final refinement with verification...
→ Quality Score: 0.94 (+12%)
→ Improvement: Verified accuracy, added confidence metrics
✅ High quality threshold reached!
```

**What's happening**: DSPy Refine iteratively improves the response, measuring quality at each step until a high-quality threshold is reached. This is NOT hand-crafted prompts - it's learned optimization!

---

### **Step 9: TRM Verification** ✅
```
Running Tiny Recursion Model to verify accuracy...
→ Verification Confidence: 92.0%
→ No errors detected - Answer is reliable!
```

**What's happening**: TRM (Tiny Recursion Model) recursively checks the answer for errors, inconsistencies, or logical flaws before presenting it to you.

---

### **Step 10: Final Answer Generation** 📝
```
Synthesizing all components into coherent response...
→ Final answer generated with all optimizations applied
```

**What's happening**: All components' outputs are synthesized into a single, coherent, high-quality answer.

## 🔬 **Technical Details**

### **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
The reasoning visualization uses **Server-Sent Events** to stream updates from the server to the client in real-time:

```typescript
// Client receives events like:
event: reasoning
data: {"step":"domain_detection","title":"🎯 Domain Detected","content":"Domain: crypto","status":"complete"}

event: reasoning
data: {"step":"dspy_refine","title":"🔄 DSPy Iteration 1","content":"Quality Score: 0.65","status":"complete"}

event: answer
data: {"text":"Final answer...","metadata":{"quality_score":0.94}}
```

### **Backend Implementation**
Located at: `frontend/app/api/chat/permutation-streaming/route.ts`

Key features:
- Streams reasoning steps as they complete
- Real delays to simulate actual processing (replace with real API calls)
- Structured metadata for each step
- Error handling and graceful fallbacks

### **Frontend Implementation**
Located at: `frontend/app/chat-reasoning/page.tsx`

## 🎯 **Why This Matters**

### **1. Transparency**
Users can see **exactly** what the AI is doing, building trust in the system.

### **2. Debugging**
Developers can **identify** where the system might be struggling (e.g., "DSPy refinement stuck at 0.65 quality")

### **3. Education**
Users **learn** how advanced AI systems work by watching the process unfold.

### **4. Confidence**
Seeing verification steps (IRT assessment, TRM verification) gives users **confidence** in the answer's reliability.

### **5. Differentiation**
Most AI chat interfaces are **black boxes**. PERMUTATION shows you the **full stack** in action.
