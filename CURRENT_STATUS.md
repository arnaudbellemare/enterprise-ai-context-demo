## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. OpenAI API Key Not Configured
**Error**: `LLM call failed: Error: OpenAI API error: Unauthorized`

**Impact**: ACE system falls back to mock LLM responses

**Fix**: Add to `frontend/.env.local`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-openai-key-here
```

**Workaround**: The system gracefully falls back to mock responses, so it still works but with simulated LLM output instead of real AI responses.

---

## 🔧 Configuration Needed

### Required API Keys

#### 1. Browserbase (Already Configured ✅)
```bash
BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=bb_live_T6sBxkEWzTTT-bG7I15sgFk1MmA
BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=4a7f24c2-3889-495a-811b-c68e3837eb08
```
**Status**: ✅ Working

#### 2. OpenAI (Needs Configuration ⚠️)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
```
**Status**: ⚠️ Not configured (using mock fallback)

**Impact**: 
- Browserbase: ✅ Real execution
- ACE/LLM: ⚠️ Mock responses (but still functional)

## 🚀 How to Get 100% Real Testing

### Step 1: Add OpenAI API Key
```bash
# Edit frontend/.env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-key
```

### Step 2: Restart Server
```bash
# Kill existing server
pkill -f "next dev"

# Start fresh
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Both Modes

**Standard Mode**:
- Uncheck "Verified Execution"
- Fast execution
- Real APIs
- Console verification

**Verified Mode**:
- Check "🔒 Verified Execution (with proof)"
- Full proof capture
- Screenshots + data
- Downloadable reports

## 🎯 What You Can Prove Right Now

Even **without** OpenAI key, you can prove:

### 1. Browserbase is REAL
- ✅ Real API calls logged
- ✅ Real session IDs
- ✅ Real timing (8-10 seconds)
- ✅ Real cost calculation
- ✅ Verifiable on Browserbase dashboard

**Console Output**:
```
🚀 Starting REAL browserbase execution...
Is Real: ✅ YES
Session ID: xxx-xxx-xxx
```

### 2. Execution is REAL
- ✅ Task description sent to API
- ✅ Real navigation attempts
- ✅ Real browser sessions created
- ✅ Real logs captured

### 3. Timing is REAL
- ✅ Not instant (takes 5-10 seconds)
- ✅ Varies by task complexity
- ✅ Network-dependent

## 📈 Comparison: What's Real vs Mock

| Aspect | Browserbase | ACE (without OpenAI key) |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|
| API Calls | ✅ REAL | ⚠️ Mock fallback |
| Session Creation | ✅ REAL | N/A |
| Browser Automation | ✅ REAL | N/A |
| Timing | ✅ REAL | ✅ REAL |
| Cost | ✅ REAL | ✅ REAL (estimation) |
| Logs | ✅ REAL | ✅ REAL (mock content) |
| Screenshots | ✅ REAL (verified mode) | N/A |
| Data Extraction | ✅ REAL (verified mode) | ⚠️ Mock LLM responses |

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Method 1: Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
Is Real: ✅ YES
```

### Method 2: Network Tab
See actual API calls to:
- `www.browserbase.com/v1/sessions`
- Real POST requests with your API key

### Method 3: Timing
- Mock data: Instant (<1 second)
- Real execution: 5-15 seconds

### Method 4: Session IDs
- Mock: Generic or missing
- Real: Unique IDs like `abc-123-def-456`

### Method 5: Browserbase Dashboard
Click "Verify on Browserbase" to see the actual session
