# üî• Crypto Liquidation Test - Real-Time Data Comparison

## The Ultimate Test

**Task**: "What are the actual crypto liquidations that happened in the last 24 hours?"

This task tests which system can actually access **real-time** market data, not just static information.

## Why This Test Matters

### Liquidations Require:
- ‚úÖ **Real-time data** (changes every minute)
- ‚úÖ **Web search** or API access
- ‚úÖ **Multiple data sources** (exchanges, aggregators)
- ‚úÖ **Current information** (must be within last 24h)

### Can't Be Faked:
- ‚ùå Can't use cached data
- ‚ùå Can't use training data
- ‚ùå Can't guess the answer
- ‚úÖ **MUST** have live internet access

## What Each System Will Show

### Browserbase (Browser Automation):
**Expected**: 
- Navigate to Coinglass or similar site
- Extract real liquidation data
- Show actual numbers from live pages
- Provide screenshots as proof

**Proof**:
- Screenshots of liquidation dashboard
- Extracted data matches current market
- Session ID verifiable on Browserbase

### Our ACE System (Smart Routing):

#### With Perplexity API (Real):
**Expected**:
- Smart router detects "liquidation" + "last 24 hours"
- Routes to Perplexity with web search
- Queries multiple sources
- Returns REAL current data

**Proof**:
- Model used: "Perplexity (sonar-pro) with Web Search"
- Response contains actual market data
- Numbers can be verified against live sources
- Citations from real websites

#### Without Perplexity API (Fallback):
**Expected**:
- Falls back to intelligent mock
- Shows **clearly labeled** simulated data
- Explains why real data isn't available
- Provides instructions to enable real API

**Proof**:
- Response shows "‚ö†Ô∏è MOCK DATA for demonstration"
- Explains API requirement
- Lower accuracy score (45% vs 87%)
- Honest about limitations

## How to Run This Test

### Step 1: Run Without Perplexity API (See the Difference)

1. **Refresh** http://localhost:3000/agent-builder-v2
2. **Click** "ü•ä Arena Comparison"
3. **Select** "üî• Crypto Liquidations (Real-Time)"
4. **Run both systems**:
   - Click "üåê Run with Browserbase"
   - Click "üß† Run with Our System + ACE"

### Expected Results (Without Perplexity):

**Browserbase**:
```
‚úÖ REAL EXECUTION COMPLETED

Extracted Data:
- page_url: "https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData"
- total_liquidations_24h: "$1.5B" (REAL NUMBER)
- long_liquidations: "$900M"
- short_liquidations: "$600M"

[+ Real screenshots showing live dashboard]
```

**ACE System**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è REAL-TIME DATA REQUIRED: Liquidation queries need live web search.

Demonstration (simulated data):

Crypto Liquidations (Last 24 Hours):
- Total Liquidations: $1.2B
- Long Liquidations: $720M (60%)
- Short Liquidations: $480M (40%)

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: This is MOCK DATA for demonstration.
Real liquidation data requires:
- Perplexity API with web search enabled
- Or direct access to Coinglass/exchange APIs

To get REAL data: Enable Perplexity API key in .env.local

Accuracy: 45% (low due to mock data)
Model used: Fallback Processing
```

### Step 2: Enable Perplexity API (See Real Power)

1. **Add to** `frontend/.env.local`:
   ```bash
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-your-key-here
   ```

2. **Restart server**:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "next dev"
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Run test again**

### Expected Results (With Perplexity):

**Browserbase**:
```
[Same as before - real browser data]
```

**ACE System**:
```
‚úÖ REAL ACE EXECUTION WITH WEB SEARCH

Crypto Liquidations (Last 24 Hours):
[ACTUAL REAL DATA FROM PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH]

According to current market data:
- Total Liquidations: $[REAL NUMBER]
- Long Liquidations: $[REAL NUMBER] 
- Short Liquidations: $[REAL NUMBER]

Top Exchanges by Liquidation Volume:
1. Binance: $[REAL] 
2. Bybit: $[REAL]
3. OKX: $[REAL]

Largest Single Liquidation:
- [REAL EVENT DESCRIPTION]

Sources: Coinglass, CoinGecko, exchange APIs
Timestamp: [CURRENT TIME]

Accuracy: 85-95% (high with real data)
Model used: Perplexity (sonar-pro) with Web Search
```

## The Comparison

### Without Perplexity API:
| System | Has Real Data | Proof | Score |
|--------|---------------|-------|-------|
| Browserbase | ‚úÖ Yes | Screenshots + extracted numbers | High |
| ACE System | ‚ùå No | Honest "MOCK DATA" disclaimer | Low (45%) |

**Winner**: Browserbase (has browser = has web access)

### With Perplexity API:
| System | Has Real Data | Proof | Score |
|--------|---------------|-------|-------|
| Browserbase | ‚úÖ Yes | Screenshots + browser session | High |
| ACE System | ‚úÖ Yes | Web search results + citations | High (85-95%) |

**Winner**: TIE (both have real data, different approaches)

## Key Insights

### Browserbase Advantage:
- ‚úÖ Always has web access (it's a browser!)
- ‚úÖ Can navigate complex UIs
- ‚úÖ Visual proof (screenshots)
- ‚ùå Slower (full browser automation)
- ‚ùå More expensive per execution

### ACE System Advantage:
- ‚úÖ Faster when API available
- ‚úÖ Cheaper (Perplexity < Browser)
- ‚úÖ Can aggregate multiple sources
- ‚úÖ Honest about limitations
- ‚ùå Requires external API for web data
- ‚ùå Can't interact with complex UIs

## Why This Test Is Perfect

1. **Can't Cheat**: Liquidation data changes constantly
2. **Easy to Verify**: Check against Coinglass.com
3. **Shows Real Capabilities**: Not just parsing/formatting
4. **Tests Honesty**: ACE admits when it can't get real data
5. **Demonstrates Value**: Shows when each system shines

## Verification Steps

### To Verify Browserbase Data:
1. Go to https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData
2. Check "Last 24H" tab
3. Compare numbers with Browserbase results
4. Should match (or be very close)

### To Verify ACE Data (with Perplexity):
1. Go to multiple sources:
   - https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData
   - https://www.bybit.com/data/basic/linear/liquidation
   - https://www.binance.com/en/futures/funding-history/perpetual
2. Compare ACE's aggregated data
3. Check if sources match ACE's citations

### To Verify ACE Is Honest (without Perplexity):
1. Check response for "‚ö†Ô∏è MOCK DATA" warning
2. Verify accuracy score is low (45%)
3. Confirm it explains API requirement
4. Check model used: "Fallback Processing"

## Success Criteria

**Browserbase Passes When:**
- [ ] Shows real browser session
- [ ] Extracts actual liquidation numbers
- [ ] Numbers match Coinglass/exchanges
- [ ] Provides screenshot proof
- [ ] Session verifiable on Browserbase

**ACE System Passes When:**
- [ ] Detects need for web search
- [ ] Routes to Perplexity when available
- [ ] Returns real data with citations (if API enabled)
- [ ] OR honestly shows "MOCK DATA" warning (if no API)
- [ ] Provides lower score for mock data
- [ ] Explains how to enable real data

## The Result

This test will show:

1. **Browserbase** = Always gets real data (browser = web access)
2. **ACE without Perplexity** = Honest about limitations
3. **ACE with Perplexity** = Gets real data via web search

**Both systems are capable, they just use different methods!**

- Browserbase: Browser automation
- ACE: Smart routing to web-search-enabled LLM

**The winner depends on what you need:**
- Need UI interaction? ‚Üí Browserbase
- Need fast aggregation? ‚Üí ACE + Perplexity
- Need honesty? ‚Üí Both! (ACE is explicit about mock data)
