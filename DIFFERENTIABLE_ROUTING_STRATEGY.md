# üß† Differentiable Routing - The Next Evolution

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current System (LLM-based routing):

Looking at our logs:
```
Line 863-889: LLM call to decide if web search needed
Line 892-928: LLM call to select which agent
Line 939-950: LLM call to execute task

Total: 3 LLM calls before getting answer
Cost: 3 √ó $0.003 = $0.009 per query
Latency: 2s + 3.5s + 3.7s = 9.2s
```

**Problems:**
1. ‚ùå **3x LLM calls** for routing alone
2. ‚ùå **9+ seconds** just for control flow
3. ‚ùå **Context inflation** (each call includes full history)
4. ‚ùå **$0.009 cost** before even answering the question
5. ‚ùå **Non-deterministic** (LLM might route differently each time)

### With Differentiable Routing:

```
Neural Router (local): 10ms, $0.00
‚Üì
Tool Selection: instant, deterministic
‚Üì
Execute ONCE: 3.7s, $0.003
‚Üì
Total: 3.7s, $0.003

Savings: 60% latency, 67% cost
```

## üéØ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Train Simple Router (Week 1)

**Collect Training Data from Our Logs:**

We already have data! From your terminal logs:
```
Input: "What are crypto liquidations in last 24h?"
Output: W (Web Search Agent)
Correct: ‚úì

Input: "Analyze this crypto data..."
Output: D (DSPy Market Analyzer)
Correct: ‚úì

Input: "Get Bitcoin price"
Output: W (Web Search)
Correct: ‚úì
```

**Create Dataset:**
```python
# scripts/create_routing_dataset.py
import json

# Extract from logs or create synthetic via GPT
training_data = [
    {"query": "crypto liquidations last 24h", "tool": "W", "features": ["real-time", "web", "data"]},
    {"query": "analyze financial report", "tool": "F", "features": ["analysis", "finance", "static"]},
    {"query": "latest news", "tool": "W", "features": ["real-time", "web", "news"]},
    # ... 100-500 examples
]

# Save for training
with open('routing_data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(training_data, f)
```

**Train Router:**
```python
# packages/optimization/differentiable_router.py
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class DifferentiableRouter(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size=50000, num_tools=13):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, 128)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 32)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(32, num_tools)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)
        
    def forward(self, token_ids):
        # token_ids shape: (batch, seq_len)
        x = self.embedding(token_ids)
        x = x.mean(dim=1)  # Average pooling
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return torch.softmax(x, dim=-1)  # Tool probabilities

# Training loop
router = DifferentiableRouter()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(router.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(10):
    for batch in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = router(batch['tokens'])
        loss = criterion(outputs, batch['labels'])
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Save trained router
torch.save(router.state_dict(), 'router_weights.pt')
```

**Result**: Local neural router, 10ms inference, 100% deterministic

---

### Phase 2: Integrate with Current System (Week 2)

**Replace LLM routing with neural router:**

```python
# apps/api/routers/optimized_routing.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

router = APIRouter()

# Load trained router
neural_router = DifferentiableRouter()
neural_router.load_state_dict(torch.load('router_weights.pt'))
neural_router.eval()

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

TOOL_MAP = {
    0: 'webSearchAgent',
    1: 'dspyMarketAnalyzer',
    2: 'gepaOptimizer',
    # ... 13 total
}

@router.post("/route")
async def route_with_neural_network(query: str):
    # Tokenize query
    tokens = tokenizer.encode(query, return_tensors='pt', max_length=128, truncation=True)
    
    # Neural routing (10ms, local, $0)
    with torch.no_grad():
        probabilities = neural_router(tokens)
        selected_tool = torch.argmax(probabilities).item()
    
    return {
        "selected_agent": TOOL_MAP[selected_tool],
        "confidence": float(probabilities[0][selected_tool]),
        "method": "neural_router",
        "latency_ms": 10,
        "cost": 0.0
    }
```

**Before (LLM routing):**
```
Query ‚Üí Perplexity ($0.003, 2s) ‚Üí Agent selection
```

**After (Neural routing):**
```
Query ‚Üí Neural Net (local, 10ms, $0) ‚Üí Agent selection
```

**Savings**: 2 seconds, $0.003 per query

---

### Phase 3: Reduce Context Inflation (Week 3)

**Problem**: Each step includes full history

**Current**:
```
Step 1: "Check if web search needed" + full query (200 tokens)
Step 2: "Select best agent" + full query + step 1 result (400 tokens)
Step 3: "Execute task" + full query + step 1 + step 2 (600 tokens)

Total context: 1200 tokens sent to LLM
```

**With Differentiable Routing**:
```
Neural Router: decides locally (0 tokens to LLM)
‚Üì
Execute ONCE: "Execute task" + query only (200 tokens)

Total context: 200 tokens to LLM
```

**Savings**: 83% token reduction = 83% cost reduction

## üí° Integration with DSPy

**DSPy already supports this!**

```python
import dspy

class DifferentiableRoutingSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Route query to optimal agent using learned weights"""
    query = dspy.InputField()
    selected_agent = dspy.OutputField(desc="Best agent for this query")

# Instead of LLM-based routing:
class NeuralRouter(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Use our trained PyTorch model
        self.router = load_trained_router()
    
    def forward(self, query):
        # Neural routing (local, fast, deterministic)
        agent_id = self.router.predict(query)
        return dspy.Prediction(selected_agent=agent_id)

# Use in pipeline
router = NeuralRouter()
agent_id = router(query="crypto liquidations").selected_agent
result = execute_agent(agent_id, query)
```

**This combines:**
- DSPy's abstractions
- Neural routing efficiency
- Your existing pipeline

## üöÄ Immediate Actions

### What to Do NOW:

1. **Collect routing data** from logs:
```bash
# Extract routing decisions from terminal logs
grep "‚ö° One-Token Routing" logs.txt > routing_data.txt

```python
# Use GPT once to generate synthetic examples
synthetic_data = gpt4.generate_routing_examples(num=500)
# One-time cost: ~$5
# Saves: $0.003 √ó 500 queries = $1.50 per 500 queries forever
```

3. **Train simple router** (1-2 hours on laptop):
```python
python train_router.py --epochs 10 --data routing_data.json
# Accuracy target: 85%+
```

4. **Deploy and A/B test**:
