User: I'm looking to transition from marketing to data science. What should I do?
Joe: That's an exciting career transition! Based on current market trends, here's what I'd recommend: First, assess your transferable skills from marketing - analytical thinking, data interpretation, and communication are valuable. Then, focus on building technical skills in Python, SQL, and machine learning. Consider taking online courses or bootcamps. Would you like specific recommendations for learning paths?

2. SQL injection vulnerability - Line 23: Direct string interpolation in SQL query.

**Improvements:**
1. Add input validation for email format
2. Implement rate limiting for login attempts
3. Add comprehensive unit tests

- Good error handling structure
- Clear variable naming
- Proper separation of concerns

**Diagnosis:** Your middle lacks tension and character growth. The protagonist needs obstacles that force internal change.

**Techniques to try:**
1. "The Midpoint Reversal" - introduce a major plot twist that changes everything
2. "Character Crucible" - put your protagonist in an impossible situation
3. "Subplot Weaving" - introduce secondary conflicts that mirror the main theme
