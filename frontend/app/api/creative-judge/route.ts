 * Creative Judge API
 * 
 * Uses powerful prompting patterns that unlock creative, non-formulaic evaluation:
 * 1. "Let's think about this differently" - Breaks cookie-cutter responses
 * 2. "What am I not seeing here?" - Finds blind spots
 * 3. "Break this down for me" - Deep analysis
 * 4. "What would you do in my shoes?" - Opinionated advice
 * 5. "Here's what I'm really asking" - Clarifies intent
 * 6. "What else should I know?" - Additional context
