## Query Analysis Features

### Business Use Case Detection

Automatically detects from:
- Keywords (insurance, legal, manufacturing, etc.)
- Task type (from Smart Router)
- Domain hints

### Complexity Estimation

Factors:
- Query length
- Use case complexity
- Multi-step reasoning indicators

### Requirements Detection

- **Verification needed**: Insurance, Legal, Healthcare, Financial
- **Retrieval needed**: Legal, Insurance (always), or query keywords
- **Real-time data**: Detected from keywords (current, latest, now)

### Language & Jurisdiction

- **Language**: Detects Spanish (es), Portuguese (pt), English (en)
- **Jurisdiction**: Detects US, LATAM, EU from keywords

---

## Workflow Customization

### Constraint-Based Optimization

```typescript
// Cost-constrained (manufacturing use case)
{
  maxCost: 0.01,
  priority: 'cost'
}
// → Disables Teacher Model, TRM, uses Student Model

// Speed-constrained
{
  maxLatency: 1000,
  priority: 'speed'
}
// → Disables TRM, SWiRL, ReasoningBank

// Quality-constrained (insurance use case)
{
  priority: 'quality'
}
// → Enables Teacher Model, TRM, full verification
```

### Complexity-Based Tuning

- **High complexity (>0.8)**: Automatically enables TRM, Teacher Model
- **Low complexity (<0.5)**: Can disable verification, use Student Model

---

## API Usage

### POST `/api/adaptive-workflow/execute`

```typescript
// Insurance Premium Query
const response = await fetch('/api/adaptive-workflow/execute', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "What is the premium for a Cartier bracelet valued at $500,000?",
    priority: 'quality'
  })
});

// LATAM Legal Query
const response = await fetch('/api/adaptive-workflow/execute', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "Analyze Mexican labor law compliance for US subsidiary",
    domain: 'legal'
  })
});

// Cost-constrained Manufacturing
const response = await fetch('/api/adaptive-workflow/execute', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "Analyze Q4 production quality metrics",
    maxCost: 0.01,
    priority: 'cost'
  })
});
```

### GET `/api/adaptive-workflow/execute`

Returns available workflow profiles:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "profiles": [
    {
      "useCase": "insurance_premium",
      "domain": "insurance",
      "requiredComponents": ["TRM Verification", "ACE Framework", ...],
      "priority": "quality",
      "expectedLatency": 2000,
      "expectedCost": 0.05
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Performance Comparison

```
Insurance Premium Query:
- All 11 components active
- Latency: ~5000ms
- Cost: $0.10
- Quality: 0.92
```

### After (Adaptive Workflow)

```
Insurance Premium Query:

- Cost: $0.05 (50% cheaper)
- Quality: 0.92 (same)
```

---

## Custom Workflow Registration

You can register custom workflows for new business use cases:

```typescript
const orchestrator = getAdaptiveWorkflowOrchestrator();

orchestrator.registerProfile({
  useCase: 'pharmaceutical',
  domain: 'pharma',
  requiredComponents: ['ACE Framework', 'TRM Verification', 'SQL Generation'],
  optionalComponents: ['ReasoningBank'],
  config: {
    enableACE: true,
    enableTRM: true,
    enableSQL: true,
    enableTeacherModel: true
  },
  priority: 'quality',
  expectedLatency: 2500,
  expectedCost: 0.06
});
```

---

## Integration with Permutation Engine

The orchestrator builds optimized `PermutationConfig` and passes it to the Permutation Engine:

```typescript
const config: PermutationConfig = {
  enableTRM: true,        // Based on workflow profile
  enableACE: true,        // Based on workflow profile
  enableReasoningBank: true, // Based on workflow profile
  enableTeacherModel: true,  // Based on priority/use case
  enableStudentModel: false, // Based on priority/use case
  // ... only enabled components
};

const engine = new PermutationEngine(config);
const result = await engine.execute(query, domain);
```

---

## Benefits

1. **Optimal Component Activation**: Only use what's needed
2. **Domain Specialization**: Each use case gets optimized workflow
3. **Cost Optimization**: Cost-sensitive use cases use Student Model
4. **Latency Reduction**: Remove unnecessary components
5. **Quality Guarantee**: High-stakes use cases use Teacher Model + TRM
6. **Automatic Detection**: No manual configuration needed
7. **Extensible**: Easy to add new business use cases

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Detection**: Train classifier for use case detection
2. **Performance Learning**: Adjust workflows based on execution history
3. **A/B Testing**: Compare workflow variants automatically
4. **Multi-Language Support**: Enhanced language detection and workflows
5. **Jurisdiction Templates**: Pre-built legal workflows for different countries
