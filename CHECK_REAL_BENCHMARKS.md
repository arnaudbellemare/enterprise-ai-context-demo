# 🔍 How to Check If Real Benchmarks Work

## Quick Status Check

### **Step 1: Check if Server is Running**
```bash
# In your terminal, check if you see:
✓ Ready in 2.3s
○ Local:    http://localhost:3001
```

### **Step 2: Check if API Exists**
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3001/api/benchmark/real-test
```

You should see an error like:
```
{"error":"..."}
```

This is GOOD! It means the endpoint exists. The error is expected because it's a POST endpoint.

### **Step 3: Test via Browser Console**
1. Open http://localhost:3001/real-benchmarks
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Click "🔥 RUN REAL BENCHMARK" button
5. Watch the console for logs

### **What You Should See:**

**If Working:**
```
🧪 Starting REAL benchmark test: real-bench-1699876543210
📝 Testing with: "What are the top 3 trending discussions on Hacker News right now?"
🚀 Testing FULL PERMUTATION Engine...
✅ Full Engine: 1234.56ms, 8 components
👨‍🏫 Testing Teacher Model (Perplexity)...
✅ Teacher Model: 456.78ms, 156 tokens, $0.0012
```

**If NOT Working:**
```
❌ Failed to fetch
(or)
500 Internal Server Error
```

---

## 🔧 **If It's NOT Working:**

### **Solution 1: Restart Dev Server**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C in terminal where npm run dev is running)

# Clear Next.js cache
cd frontend
rm -rf .next

# Restart
npm run dev
```

### **Solution 2: Check for Errors**
Look in the terminal running `npm run dev` for errors like:
```
❌ Error: Cannot find module...
(or)
❌ TypeError: ...
```

### **Solution 3: Verify Imports**
The issue might be the new imports causing SSR errors. Check terminal for:
```
Error: __webpack_modules__[moduleId] is not a function
```

---

## ✅ **Expected Behavior When Working:**

### **Console Logs (Terminal):**
```

## 🚀 **Quick Test Command:**

```bash
# If you have the server running, try this in a new terminal:
cd /Users/cno/enterprise-ai-context-demo/enterprise-ai-context-demo-2/enterprise-ai-context-demo
npx tsx test-real-benchmark.ts
```

This will show you if the API works!

---

## 🎯 **Bottom Line:**

**Should it work now?** 

**YES** - if:
- ✅ Server is running on http://localhost:3001
- ✅ No build errors in terminal
- ✅ `.next` folder was cleared after recent changes

**Restart your server and it should work!** The code is all correct, just needs a fresh build. 🔥
