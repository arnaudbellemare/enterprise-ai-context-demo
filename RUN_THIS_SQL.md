# 🚀 Fix Memory Search - Add Sample Real Estate Data

## Why Memory Search Uses Mock Data

The Memory Search node is returning mock data because your Supabase database is empty (no memories, documents, or embeddings).

**Error you're seeing:**
```
"Mock property data. Search failed - using mock data: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"
```

## ✅ Quick Fix - Run This SQL Migration

### **Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `ofvbywlqztkgugrkibcp`
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"New query"**

---

### **Step 2: Copy & Paste This SQL**

Open the file:
```
supabase/migrations/003_workflow_memory_system_FINAL.sql
```

**Or copy from here** (it's the complete migration that adds):
- ✅ Database schema (collections, memories, documents, embeddings)
- ✅ Sample real estate data (8 industries including Real Estate)
- ✅ Vector indexes for fast similarity search
- ✅ RLS policies for security
- ✅ Search functions

---

### **Step 3: Execute the SQL**

1. **Paste** the entire SQL into the editor
2. **Click** "Run" or press Cmd+Enter
3. **Wait** for "Success. No rows returned" message

**Expected output:**
```
Success. No rows returned
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify It Worked**

Run this query to check:
```sql
-- Check if data was inserted
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM collections) as collections_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM memories) as memories_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM documents) as documents_count;
```

**Expected result:**
```
collections_count: 8
memories_count: 40+
documents_count: 8+
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### **Before (current state):**
```
🔍 Memory Search → ❌ Mock data
📊 Result: "Mock property data. Search failed..."
```

### **After (with sample data):**
```
🔍 Memory Search → ✅ Real vector search
📊 Result: "Found 5 real estate memories with 0.85 similarity"
```

  ],
  "totalResults": 5,
  "note": "Real vector search results from Supabase"
}
```

### **Complex Workflow will be 100% Real:**
```
✅ Web Search - Real Perplexity
✅ Memory Search - Real Supabase vector search (no more mock!)
✅ Context Assembly - Real RAG merging

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### **Check Current State:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM memories;
-- If 0, you need to run the migration
```

### **Run Migration:**
```sql
-- Copy entire contents of:
-- supabase/migrations/003_workflow_memory_system_FINAL.sql
-- Paste and execute
```

### **Verify:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM collections LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM memories WHERE collection_id = (
  SELECT id FROM collections WHERE name = 'Real Estate Market Intelligence'
) LIMIT 5;
```
