# TypeScript/JavaScript Code Standards

## Type Safety
- Use strict TypeScript types, avoid `any`
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use proper error handling with typed exceptions

## Code Organization
- Follow the modular architecture defined in [ARCHITECTURE.md](mdc:ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Components should implement the `Component` interface pattern
- Use dependency injection for testability

## Performance
- Cache expensive operations using the established caching patterns
- Use async/await consistently
- Implement proper rate limiting for external APIs

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all components
- Use the existing test patterns in the `test-*.js` files
- Mock external dependencies properly
